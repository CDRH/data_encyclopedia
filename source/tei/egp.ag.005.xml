<head type="main">AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SERVICE</head>

<p>Created to help farmers rationalize and modernize
their operations, the Agricultural Extension
Service (<hi rend="smallcaps">AES</hi>) is a cooperative venture
between federal, state, and local governments;
land grant colleges and universities; and agricultural
experiment stations. Growing out
of late-nineteenth-century farmers institutes,
efforts by reformers like Dr. Seaman Knapp,
and concerns raised by the Country Life Commission
of 1908, the extension service received
federal funding with the 1914 Smith-Lever Act.
Individual states, counties, and farmers organizations
such as the Farm Bureau also provided
funding over the years.</p>

<p>State extension offices and county agents
conducted research and provided expertise on
farm management; Plains-worthy strains of
grasses and small grains; animal husbandry;
marketing and bookkeeping; and controlling
pests like gophers, grasshoppers, and Russian
thistle. Agents also supervised clubs for boys
and girls and developed home extension programs
for farm wives. The larger mission of
the aes included not only aiding rural Americans
in improving their agricultural operations
but also developing local leadership and
improving the quality of rural life through
better health and community activities.</p>

<p>The extension service expanded quickly
during World War I, when the Food Production
Act of 1917 provided funds for extension
agents in each county in the United States. But
the long agricultural depression that followed
challenged the assumptions and even the survival
of the <hi rend="smallcaps">AES</hi> in many Great Plains states. By
the early 1930s, many counties had closed their
extension offices. In South Dakota, for instance,
only sixteen counties&#8211;about a quarter&#8211;
had <hi rend="smallcaps">AES</hi> agents by late 1932, while nationally
the number of agricultural agents and
home extension agents declined by one-third
and one-half, respectively.</p>

<p>Even as the Depression and the drought of
the 1930s created an unprecedented crisis for
Great Plains farmers, it reinvigorated the extension
service, which implemented the Agricultural
Adjustment Administration in 1933.
Agents' heroic coordination of life- and farmsaving
federal programs tempered most farmers'
traditional mistrust of federal bureaucracies,
including the extension service. In
addition, state legislatures placed the aes on a
much more stable financial footing. Over the
next several decades, state and county agents
once again mobilized farmers for a world war;
helped farmers adapt to technological and
chemical innovations and make the transition
in livestock production from the open range
to the farm; extended its mission to urban
gardeners; and became involved in environmental
issues, as in Montana, where the <hi rend="smallcaps">AES</hi>
helped reclaim land marred by open pit coal
mining.</p>

<p>Nearly a century after the extension service
appeared, it remains a largely local bureau
dedicated to education rather than policymaking,
with two-thirds of its nearly 17,000
employees working at the county level. The
top programming priorities remain agriculture
and home economics, with 4-H/Youth
programs a close third, and community development
fourth. Although federal funding
has been reduced in recent years, the <hi rend="smallcaps">AES</hi> is
still cooperatively sponsored by federal, state,
and county governments. The traditional
focus on education&#8211;through small group
demonstrations, one-on-one contacts, publications,
and other mass media outlets&#8211;
continues to shape extension activities.</p>
