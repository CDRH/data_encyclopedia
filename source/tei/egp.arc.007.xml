<p>Rural cemeteries in the Great Plains are familiar,
ritual landscapes that serve a fundamental
human need for remembrance, commemoration,
and spiritual healing. Historically, people
have sought out places of natural beauty as
burial sites and attempted to cultivate natural
beauty according to a sense of ritual order
they regarded as appropriate. Cultural notions
about death and the commemoration of departed
loved ones make cemeteries rich places
in which to look for expressions of cultural
meaning. The mosaic of burial traditions in
the Great Plains is as varied as other cultural
indicators. Observers of the Great Plains landscape
can discern a range of cemetery types,
including cemeteries associated with country
churches, designed or otherwise planned secular
cemeteries in many towns and cities, and
cemeteries with distinctively ethnic characteristics.
A more recent phenomenon in Great
Plains cemeteries, as elsewhere, is the lawn
cemetery or memorial garden with minimally
visible, flat stone markers.</p>

<p>The most widespread and familiar cemetery
tradition on the Plains is cemeteries
alongside country churches connected with a
particular religious denomination and a specific
congregation. These cemeteries have
often outlasted the churches themselves after
their congregations have dwindled. Country
church cemeteries display an orderliness according
to rules that vary with religious sect.
Many Catholic cemeteries, for example, exhibit
perimeter rows of trees and occasional
walking paths that connect stations of the
cross. Some church cemeteries historically encouraged
burial plots grouped according to
family, while others simply allocated each
grave site in chronological sequence based on
the order in which members of the community
died. Most cemeteries adjacent to country
churches were laid out according to a simple,
classical sense of order, generally symmetrically
and in straight rows, often alongside a
straight access driveway.</p>

<p>A romantic, Victorian vision of death permeated
many social groups at the time communities
were being established in the Great
Plains. In the mid-1800s landscape architects
in large eastern cities designed cemeteries
according to a newly conceived cemeteryplanning
tradition called the "Rural Romantic"
cemetery movement. These picturesque,
naturalistic cemeteries were widely copied
and adapted in parklike cemeteries constructed
in the Great Plains around the turn of
the twentieth century, particularly in towns
but also in some country cemeteries. In addition
to less formal arrangement, Rural Romantic
cemeteries often display tranquil water
elements, weeping trees and groupings of
plants with varied textures, and overtly reflective
markers with symbolic meanings. In general,
plant materials in Great Plains cemeteries
include more diverse and prized cultivars than
one might expect to find in the surrounding
landscape. Cemeteries change significantly
over the seasons as graves are marked with
holiday decorations.</p>

<p>Ideas about cemeteries and burial practices
are persistent over time, and there is good indication
that ethnic populations on the Plains
adhered to conservative funerary customs imported
directly from native homelands. Ethnicity
and religious affiliation clearly influenced
the layout of rural cemeteries. Czech
American cemeteries on the Plains (including
cemeteries designed by secular associations
and those consecrated by more traditional
Catholic congregations) were laid out in a
highly formalized order, with a gridded configuration
and a formal all&#233;e, or double row of
trees, flanking the driveway. Moravian cemeteries
were customarily divided into choirs,
grouped by age, gender, and marital status.
German Americans, Black Sea German Americans,
and Ukrainian Americans consecrated
some of the most austere, strikingly powerful,
and isolated cemeteries, reflecting previous
settlement experiences and the harsh circumstances
of life in the Great Plains. Handcrafted
wrought-iron crosses are a conspicuous feature
marking graves in these cemeteries. On
the Southern Plains, Hispanic cemeteries, or
<hi rend="italic">camposantos</hi>, reflect traditions of burial in
which individual graves are differentiated with
low fences (termed <hi rend="italic">cerquitas</hi>) and niches for
sacred reliquary objects. The scraped or swept
grave, often attributed to African influences,
is a distinctive tradition in cemeteries on the
Southern Plains. Other common characteristics
of African American burial grounds
are the use of homemade grave markers,
mounded earth over graves, and "found object"
grave decorations such as bottles and
light bulbs. Distinctive ethnic traditions can
be observed in cemeteries established by many
other groups.</p>

<p>In addition to location and overall layout,
cemeteries are made distinctive by the features
and details constructed within them. Typically,
grave markers in most Great Plains cemeteries
are made of stone, although there are
many examples of wooden, concrete, and
wrought-iron markers. Iconographic symbolism
often coincides with one of the three traditions
described above. In classical church
cemeteries, upright stones with family names
can be expected. Many Rural Romantic cemeteries
include benches for reflection, obelisks,
and markers either in the shape of broken tree
trunks or topped with urns covered by a
draped cloth. Messages inscribed on grave
markers range from cowboy epitaphs to academic
poetry, memorial photographs, and
beautifully composed foreign-language remembrances.
Other constructed features include
perimeter fences, setting the cemetery
apart from its surroundings, and distinctive
ornamental gates that often bear the name of
the cemetery or congregation. Many local and
state historical societies have genealogy interest
groups that specialize in informative cemetery
grave marker research and inventories.</p>
