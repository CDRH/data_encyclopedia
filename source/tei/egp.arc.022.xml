<p>In the nineteenth century, army posts throughout
the Great Plains region varied widely in
appearance, reflecting the lack of a centralized
design authority. Post commanders exercised
great latitude in construction decisions, often
relying on poorly trained lieutenants who
designed buildings and oversaw their construction.
Low levels of funding forced these
officers to rely on available materials and expertise,
resulting in a diverse array of architecture
within forts as well as among them.
Nonetheless, two aspects of fort design were
consistent: the general layout and the expression
of the military hierarchy in the architecture
of the quarters.</p>

<p>Contrary to the usual image of a fort, stockades
were rare, especially in the Great Plains,
where wood was hard to obtain. Examples of
perimeter vertical-log stockades include Fort
Phil Kearny in present-day Wyoming and
Fort Rice, North Dakota, as well as Canadian
North-West Mounted Police forts of the
1870s such as Fort Macleod, Alberta, and Fort
Walsh, Saskatchewan. Without a stockade, a
fort could be entered at any point; access was
not controlled. All forts had a parade ground,
an open space in the center where troops
could assemble. The primary buildings&#8211;officers' quarters, barracks, headquarters building,
guardhouse&#8211;faced this parade ground,
with secondary structures, including stables,
workshops, laundresses' quarters, and hospital,
behind it.</p>

<p>The only published army regulation concerning
the architecture of a fort allocated the
number of rooms by rank, limiting lieutenants,
for instance, to one room plus a kitchen.
As a result, the highest-ranking officer at
a post had the largest house. Officers' quarters
were domestic in appearance, with front
porches, gable roofs, and picket-fenced yards.
Often, lower-ranking officers occupied double
quarters with separate entrances. Barracks
were long, one- or two-story structures, with
their broad fronts facing the parade ground.
One open room served as the dormitory for
an entire company; mess halls and kitchens
were in separate structures, in wings off the
rear, or on the first floor of two-story buildings.
Designs for these buildings originated at
the post, and the quartermaster general could
approve or reject them.</p>

<p>The individuality of the forts was particularly
evident in the building materials employed.
The army authorized permanent forts
to be built of stone or brick. Temporary
forts&#8211;which was the designation of most
forts in the Great Plains, despite their decadeslong
utilization&#8211;could employ stone only if
it were cheaper than alternatives. Troops
built wood-framed buildings with board-and-batten
or clapboarded walls, as at North Platte
Station, Nebraska, on the Union Pacific Railroad
line. Cruder, quicker wood buildings included
"picket" or "stockade" buildings constructed
of small-diameter vertical logs, as at
Fort Richardson, Texas. Panel construction&#8211;
horizontal logs let into vertical posts, which
fashioned short timber into long buildings&#8211;
proved to be the most expedient form of
log construction, as seen at Fort Robinson,
Nebraska.</p>

<p>Because of the scarcity of wood throughout
much of the region, army officers sought alternative
materials. Adobe&#8211;earth formed
into bricks and dried in the sun.found extensive
use at forts ranging from Fort Davis,
Texas, to Fort Laramie, Wyoming, and Fort
Shaw, Montana. The army also experimented
with concrete construction. Officers at Sidney
Barracks, Nebraska, in 1872 used a "limegrout"
mixture of lime, sand, aggregate, and
no cement. Soon after, officers at Fort Laramie,
Wyoming, and Fort Hartsuff, Nebraska,
constructed most of their new buildings of
concrete.</p>

<p>In 1882 Commanding General William T.
Sherman outlined his plans for concentrating
his troops in the West into fewer, larger posts.
By 1891 111 western forts had been reduced to
62. The quartermaster general's officce took an
active role in rebuilding the posts, producing
standardized plans by the mid-1890s. These
new brick buildings&#8211;barracks as well as officers'
quarters&#8211;were spacious and imposing.
The standardized plans employed a Spanish
Colonial appearance for forts in the southwestern
Plains, including Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
and an English Colonial Revival style for the
rest, including Fort D. A. Russell in Wyoming.
Buildings at different posts now resembled
each other closely; for example, designs for
buildings at Fort D. A. Russell served as models
for other forts across the country, including
the officers' quarters at Fort George
Wright, Washington, and the commanding
officer's quarters at Fort Totten, North Dakota.
Use of standardized designs issued from
Washington <hi rend="smallcaps">DC</hi> continued through the twentieth
century, resulting in an increasingly uniform
military architecture nationwide.</p>
