<p>Solomon Andrew Layton was a prolific architect
of early statehood Oklahoma. Twenty-two
of his buildings are listed on the National Register
of Historic Places, a record unmatched
among the state's architects. Born in Red Oak,
Iowa, on July 22, 1864, he died in Oklahoma
City on February 6, 1943.</p>

<p>Layton began practice in Denver in 1887
and moved to El Reno in central Oklahoma in
1902. Three years later he moved to Oklahoma
City, where he headed an architectural firm
until his death. Alone and with different partners,
he designed more than 100 public, educational,
and commercial buildings (a majority
of which remain) and many private
residences. Layton powerfully influenced the
buildings of early statehood Oklahoma. His
works are recognized for their endurance
and for setting a standard of stability and
rich design that continues to enhance the built
environment.</p>

<p>Among Layton's accomplishments are the
Oklahoma State Capitol, the governor's mansion,
more than one-fifth of the state's seventyseven
county courthouses, and at least fortyfive
Oklahoma City public schools, including
the city's first six junior high schools and first
five high schools. In addition, Layton designed several corporate headquarters, office
buildings, department stores, mental hospitals,
a museum, correctional facilities, and
public and private higher education projects.
Fourteen downtown Oklahoma City highrises
built from 1909 to 1929 were designed
by the Layton firm. Layton took advantage of
new oil wealth to grace his projects with marble,
limestone, sculpted terra-cotta, and often
opulent interiors.</p>

<p>On the University of Oklahoma main campus
at Norman, Layton fashioned original
sections of the library, the administration
building, and the football stadium, all still in
use. The Layton firm designed the original
College of Medicine and Children's Hospital
at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences
Center in Oklahoma City. Both were
still used in the early twentieth-first century.
The Oklahoma State Capitol (designed with S.
Wemyss Smith and built from 1914 to 1917) is a
neoclassical structure with four-story-tall
Corinthian columns on all sides. The interior
was altered to gain space in the 1930s to the
1950s but has since undergone a historical restoration.
Oklahoma City Central High, Oklahoma's
first four-year high school, built in
1908–9, illustrates the adaptability of Layton's
works. Abandoned as a sprawling innercity
school in the 1970s, it was remodeled as
Southwestern Bell Telephone headquarters.
The 1936 Oklahoma County Courthouse in
downtown Oklahoma City is a monument of
Depression-era Art Deco. The Skirvin Hotel
(1911) is famous for its oilman founder, William
Balser Skirvin, and his daughter, Perle
Mesta, Washington <hi rend="smallcaps">DC</hi> social leader and minister
to Luxembourg from 1949 to 1953. The
Skirvin sheltered royalty, U.S. presidents, and
early cattle and oil barons. The 1910 Baum
Building, one of Oklahoma City's first highrises,
was patterned after the doge's palace in
Venice. Along with Layton's elaborately ornamented
Patterson Building and Halliburton
Department Store, the Baum Building fell victim
to urban renewal.</p>

<p>The neoclassical Shrine Auditorium (1925.
26), later remodeled as the Journal Record Office
Building, Central High (Southwestern
Bell), and the original Oklahoma Publishing
Company headquarters are three Layton
works on the National Register to survive the
April 19, 1995, terrorist bombing of the A. P.
Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma
City. The Shrine Auditorium and the
publishing building suffered extensive damage;
Central High sustained less damage. Yet
all three remained structurally sound in the
late 1990s. Central High and the publishing
buildings have since been restored, and the
Shrine Auditorium is being incorporated into
the bombing memorial as an interpretive museum,
with full restoration scheduled.</p>
