<head type="main">SCHWARZ, JOSEPH (1858-1927)</head>

<p>Born in New York City on February 22, 1858,
Joseph Schwarz moved with his family to La
Crosse, Wisconsin, in 1861. He trained in
the family firm as a cabinetmaker and later
worked for a contracting company. Schwarz
moved to Dakota Territory in the early 1880s.
By 1887 he was a practicing architect in Sioux
Falls.</p>

<p>A devout Catholic, Schwarz was long associated
with the Diocese of Sioux Falls. Between
1895 and 1924 he designed at least twenty Catholic
churches in South Dakota and Nebraska
as well as schools and parish houses. Schwarz
preferred the Gothic style for his churches, a
design aesthetic that met with approval from
the mostly German and Czech parishioners.
His most notable church buildings include
St. Mary's in Salem, South Dakota (1896);
St. Wenceslaus' in Tabor, South Dakota (1898–
99); Saints Peter and Paul in Bow Valley, Nebraska
(1903); and Holy Family in Mitchell,
South Dakota (1903–6).</p>

<p>Two of Schwarz's sons, both trained architects,
joined the firm after 1900, and their designs
began to shift toward classical motifs.
Also at this time the firm began to receive
significant public commissions. Several of the
most noteworthy are the Carnegie Library in
Sioux Falls, South Dakota (1903); Sioux Falls
High School (1906); the Lyon County Courthouse
in Rock Rapids, Iowa (1915); and the
administration building at South Dakota State
University in Brookings, South Dakota (1912–
18). Joseph Schwarz died in Sioux Falls on December
26, 1927.</p>
