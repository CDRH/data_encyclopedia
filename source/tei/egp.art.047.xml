<head type="main">PENN, ROBERT LEE (1946-1999)</head>

<p>From the late 1960s until his death on February
7, 1999, Robert Lee Penn was one of the
most outstanding Northern Plains Indian artists
of his generation.</p>

<p>Penn was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on
May 3, 1946, to an Omaha father and Brule
Lakota mother. He grew up on the Winnebago
Indian Reservation in Nebraska and the Rosebud
Reservation in South Dakota, a background
that would define his cultural roots
and his art. During his years as a student at the
University of South Dakota (1967-72), Penn
began his formal art studies with the renowned
Yanktonai Nakota artist Oscar Howe. After
graduation, Penn continued his creative efforts
while working as an illustrator, designer, and
teacher. Over a period of twenty-five years he
exhibited his work regularly in numerous oneman
exhibitions and many others.</p>

<p>Penn mastered the technical means of
drawing, watercolor, and painting and used
them to express his very personal experience
of being a traditional Indian in contemporary
America. He considered that, as a Native
American in contemporary society, his role
was that of both artist and interpreter, using
his art to convey cultural themes. His work is
characterized by sure drawing combined with
a strong sense of color and dynamic design,
which he used to eloquently express the vital
juncture between Plains Indian worlds, past
and present.</p>
