<head type="main">REAUGH, FRANK (1860-1945)</head>

<p>Called the "dean of Texas painters," Frank
Reaugh was born near Jacksonville, Illinois,
on December 29, 1860. In 1876 he and his family
settled on a farm near Terrell, Texas. His
mother taught him natural history, and his
father taught him to work with his hands.
Later, Frank made his own picture frames and
patented several inventions.</p>

<p>Reaugh honed his skills by copying reproductions
from popular magazines, and he
taught himself cattle and sheep anatomy.
He also sketched longhorn cattle that were
brought up from South Texas to fatten on the
prairies nearby. As early as 1883 Reaugh began
sketching&#8211;often from the saddle&#8211;cattle
drives and roundups near Wichita Falls. He
later enlarged and refined his sketches in his
studio, creating paintings such as <title>The One-O Roundup</title> (1894). Reaugh's formal studies began
at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts in
1884–85 and continued at the Académie Julian
in Paris in 1888–89. While in Europe he copied
paintings in the Louvre and studied paintings
in Belgium and Holland. Reaugh exhibited
widely, including at the World's Columbian
Exposition, the National Academy of
Design, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine
Arts, the Chicago Art Institute, and the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition. He also joined the
Society of Western Artists, exhibiting with
them all over the United States.</p>

<p>Reaugh continued his annual sketching
trips to the Texas Plains until he was almost
eighty. He had been taking students, including
Alexandre Hogue and Florence McClung, on
trips there since 1910. Reaugh died in Dallas
on May 6, 1945, and is buried in the Terrell
cemetery. The Panhandle-Plains Historical
Museum at Canyon, Texas, is the repository
for Reaugh's works and papers.</p>
