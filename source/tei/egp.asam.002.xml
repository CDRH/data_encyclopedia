</figure>

<p>On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 authorizing
the removal of more than 110,000 Americans
of Japanese ancestry from their homes
on the West Coast of the United States. Under
the auspices of the War Relocation Authority
(<hi rend="smallcaps">WRA</hi>), the federal government eventually
imprisoned these Japanese Americans, twothirds
of whom were native-born citizens, in
ten internment camps—Manzanar and Tule
Lake in California, Jerome and Rohwer in Arkansas,
Colorado River (Poston) and Gila
River in Arizona, Central Utah (Topaz) in
Utah, Heart Mountain in Wyoming, Minidoka
in Idaho, and Amache (Granada) in Colorado.</p>

<p>Camp Amache, located in southeastern
Colorado, had been under construction for
only two months when the first 212 prisoners
arrived from California on August 27, 1942.
Although only a portion of the camp was habitable,
the Western Defense Command refused
to alter its schedule of removals. By the
end of September nearly 5,000 people were in
camp, and within six months the population
of Amache exceeded 7,500. Camp Amache virtually
overnight had become the tenth-largest
city in the state. But it was a peculiar city.
Hastily built, enclosed by barbed wire, and
still unfinished when the bulk of the evacuees
arrived, it had only the most rudimentary facilities. Even with the internees themselves
assisting the wra in various construction
projects during these early months, mess halls
were inadequate, bathhouses were without
water, toilets were unsightly and unsanitary,
and drinking water had to be trucked in from
the nearby town of Granada.</p>

<p>In spite of the treatment they were accorded,
or perhaps because of it, the men and
women of Amache proceeded quickly to set
up a system of democratic self-government.
The camp charter, which had been drafted
by early November 1942, was prefaced with
a preamble that began with the words "We
the People of Granada Relocation Center" and
continued self-consciously to echo phrases
contained in the preamble to the Constitution
of the United States. As specified in the charter,
a popularly elected community council,
consisting of one representative from each of
the twenty-nine blocks into which Amache's
348 barracks were organized, formed the core
of camp government. It was responsible for
establishing local ordinances, appointing an
eight-member judicial commission to preside
over all cases except felonies, and naming
a fifteen-member arbitration commission to
settle civil disputes.</p>

<p>Within a year after the charter had received
the approval of the <hi rend="smallcaps">WRA</hi>, life in Amache assumed
a semblance of normality: a police
force of sixty men and a fire department of
twenty-four to thirty men, assisted by a corps
of voluntary firemen, were fully operational;
the camp post office handled 2,500 letters and
400 packages daily; the <title level="j">Granada Pioneer</title>
spread the news to approximately 3,000 readers
on a biweekly basis; a 150-bed hospital,
staffed by five internee doctors and twentyfive
nurses or nurse's aides, in conjunction
with an outpatient clinic, treated 800 patients
a week; a dental clinic with seven internee
dentists dealt with 125 emergency cases daily;
the local public library accumulated a collection
of more than 4,500 books; and the education
system enrolled 1,900 students in various
grade levels ranging from preschool to senior
high school. Because a workforce of nearly
3,500 internees formed the backbone of all of
these enterprises, wra officials, with apparently
little sense of the irony of the situation,
were quick to announce that the program of
"rehabilitating" the evacuees was progressing
smoothly and that therefore the majority of
those interned would soon be qualified to enter
the "mainstream of normal American life."</p>

<p>What perhaps impressed wra authorities
most were the successes of the camp farm and
cooperative. The farm, which was the largest
employer at Amache, encompassed some
10,000 acres, two-thirds of which were under
irrigation at any given time. Contrary to
the predictions of many local growers, the
Amache farmers raised bumper crops of alfalfa,
corn, and sorghum which, when coupled
with harvests of head-lettuce, celery,
spinach, onions, and lima beans, enabled
them to export railroad carloads of produce
to points outside Colorado. In 1943 alone,
the total value of crops grown at Amache was
$190,000. The cooperative begun in January
1943, the Amache Consumers' Enterprises,
Inc., was similarly successful. With a membership
in excess of 2,300 internees, the co-op
brought into camp everyday items and services
available to Americans on the outside. In
its first year of operation, the co-op grossed
more than $362,000 and became one of the
largest organizations in the state.</p>

<p>But life at Amache in 1943 was not entirely
reassuring to wra officials. In February the
wra and the War Department jointly began to
register all adults in the ten internment camps
in the United States. As part of the registration
procedure, internees were required to complete
a questionnaire whose primary purpose
was to measure "loyalty." Question 27 asked
the internees whether they were willing to

serve in the armed forces, and question 28
asked them whether they were willing to forswear
any form of allegiance to the emperor of
Japan. Based on the answers respondents gave
to these two loaded questions, <hi rend="smallcaps">WRA</hi> officials
segregated "loyals" from "disloyals." At
Amache, the result was the removal of a small
group of "disloyals" to Tule Lake, California,
and the arrival of the first group of "loyals"
from Tule Lake in September 1943. Eventually,
more than 1,000 Tule Lake internees were relocated
to Amache. James G. Lindley, the director
of Camp Amache, was not pleased with
the exchange. Loyalty aside, the "Tuleans,"
Lindley said, were troublemakers who resented
internment and were unwilling to forget
the "wrongs" they had suffered.</p>

<p>To Lindley's dismay, the Tule Lake contingent
soon dominated the community council
and voiced challenges not only to his policies
but also to those of the federal government.
Most notably, some of the former Tule Lake
internees questioned the federal government's
policy of drafting nisei men into military service
while holding them and their families
prisoners. Despite such protest, 494 men from
Amache served in the military of a nation that
classified them as "undesirable aliens." Thirtyeight
of them earned combat decorations
for exemplary conduct under fire; thirty-one
were killed in action.</p>

<p>The courage and sacrifices of these men and
the other Japanese American soldiers of the
442nd Regimental Combat Team and 100th
Infantry Battalion accelerated the pace of the
federal government's program to close the nation's
internment camps. However, in late 1944
there were still more than 6,100 internees
at Amache. In January 1945 the government
lifted its ban on resettlement on the West
Coast, and in March the wra announced that
it was no longer necessary for internees to secure
prior approval of their relocation plans.
By this time, those remaining at Amache were
apprehensive about leaving camp, fearful of
what awaited them on the outside. The <title level="j">Denver Post</title> had only recently referred to them as "Japanese
enemies," local farmers now complained
about them possessing the best farmland in
the state, the Colorado House of Representatives
passed a bill (defeated in the Senate) banning
ethnic Japanese from owning land in the
state, and local merchants in nearby towns still
posted "No Japs Allowed" signs in their windows.
Not until October 15, 1945, two months
after the end of the war in the Pacific, did
the last internees leave Amache. "What does
America mean to you?" Marion Konishi, valedictorian
of Amache High School, asked her
classmates in 1943. It is a question that should
resonate with us all.</p>
