<head type="main">CHINESE</head>

<p>During the summer of 1875, Sin Goon, a Chinese
immigrant, arrived in the Great Plains in
search of a prosperous town where he could
open a laundry. While traveling through Nebraska
he visited the nascent railroad town of
North Platte. Impressed with the town's possibilities
as a growing commercial center on the
transcontinental line, Goon opened what was
probably the first Chinese-owned business in
western Nebraska.</p>

<p>Sin Goon was one of the relatively few Chinese
who chose to settle in the Great Plains
during the nineteenth century. In 1870, for example,
no Chinese lived in either Nebraska
or Kansas. By 1890 census takers enumerated
only 214 in Nebraska and 93 in Kansas. The
Canadian Plains attracted even fewer Chinese
during this period. Only 80 Chinese lived in
Calgary in 1900. Chinese immigrants, who began
arriving in the United States around 1850,
tended to settle in the far western states, primarily
California. They came to the United
States as sojourners, with the intention of
making a fortune and then returning home.
Thus, the first Chinese immigrants worked
in the mining regions of the American West.
Only the western fringe of the Great Plains
offered Chinese immigrants opportunities in
mining: Colorado, the Black Hills, Montana,
and Wyoming. Denver quickly gathered the
largest concentration of Chinese in the Plains;
in 1890 almost 1,000 Chinese lived in "Hop
Alley," the city's Chinatown.</p>

<p>While mining was the original economic
attraction for Chinese immigrants, they also
played an important role in nineteenth-century
railroad construction, particularly on the
Canadian Plains. Between 1881 and 1883 Chinese
contract laborers helped build the Canadian
Pacific Railway across the Prairies. Most
Chinese returned home or migrated to the
United States after the railroad was completed,
but many settled permanently in Prairie
cities such as Edmonton, Calgary, and
Medicine Hat.</p>

<p>Service industries provided yet another
economic opportunity for Chinese immigrants.
Chinatowns in Denver; Butte, Montana;
Deadwood, South Dakota; and Calgary
supported a wide variety of Chinese-owned
laundries, restaurants, gambling houses, and
mercantile businesses. During the 1870s and
1880s enterprising Chinese entrepreneurs like
Sin Goon left the Chinese enclaves of the mining
West and opened service businesses in
Plains towns such as North Platte, Nebraska,
and Wichita, Kansas. Because Great Plains
communities could support only a limited
number of service-oriented businesses, Chinese
businessmen were scattered across the
Plains, often living alone and distant from fellow
countrymen. In 1890, for example, Nebraska's
railroad towns generally had one or
two Chinese laundries and perhaps a Chinese
restaurant: two Chinese lived in Sidney, two
in North Platte, one in Lexington, two in
Kearney, and three in Grand Island.</p>

<p>While the Chinese may have found economic
opportunity in Great Plains communities
they still could not escape from the racism,
discrimination, and violence that plagued the
Pacific and Rocky Mountain West. By the 1870s
economic depression and racism produced a
virulent anti-Chinese movement in California,
which then spread to other regions of the
American West. Towns such as Los Angeles,
Tacoma, and Seattle witnessed anti-Chinese
riots; in 1871 Los Angeles mobs killed twentytwo
Chinese. The Great Plains was not immune
to such intolerance. In 1880 rioters destroyed
Denver's Chinatown, killing one Chinese
launderer, while in 1885 at Rock Springs,
Wyoming, a mob killed twenty-six Chinese
miners. Although less violent than their
American counterparts, Canadians also repressed
their Chinese population. On August
2, 1892, for example, a Calgary mob destroyed
the city's Chinese businesses. Sin Goon also
experienced intolerance and violence in North
Platte. Just weeks after his arrival Goon was
warned to leave town by the non-Chinese
launderers. When Goon refused, his competitors
hired thugs to break the windows of his
laundry. Goon hastily left North Platte, but
instead of abandoning the Plains he moved
down the Union Pacific line and opened another
laundry in Grand Island.</p>

<p>After 1890 the Chinese population in the
Plains began to decline, largely the result
of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which
nearly halted all Chinese immigration to the
United States. As a "bachelor society" with
few women, the Chinese population in the
United States could not sustain itself by natural
increase. Between 1890 and 1900 the Chinese
population in the United States fell from
105,828 to 74,013. During these same years Nebraska's
Chinese population fell from 214 to
190 while Colorado's dropped from 1,398 to
960.</p>

<p>Chinese immigration to the United States
did not resume until after 1947, when prohibitive
immigration restrictions were lifted. Further
immigration reform in both the United
States and Canada during the 1960s sparked a
new wave of immigration from China, primarily
professionals and businessmen. As Sin
Goon had done in the 1870s, Chinese returned
to the Plains in search of economic opportunities.
In the early twenty-first century,
Plains towns such as Denver, Fort Worth, and
Oklahoma City in the United States and Calgary,
Edmonton, and Lethbridge in Canada
have thriving Chinese communities, composed
of women and children as well as men,
and of scientists and doctors as well as launderers
and restaurateurs.</p>
