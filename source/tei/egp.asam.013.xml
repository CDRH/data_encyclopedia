<p>William K. Hosokawa was not born in the
Great Plains&#8211;he was born on January 30, 1915,
in Seattle, Washington&#8211;but he moved to the
region as a young man and spent more than
forty years as an award-winning journalist for
the Denver Post and historian for the Japanese
American Citizens League (<hi rend="smallcaps">JACL</hi>).</p>

<p>Hosokawa's parents were first-generation
Japanese immigrants (<hi rend="italic">issei</hi>). As a youngster
Hosokawa spoke Japanese and did not learn
English until he attended public school. From
an early age he had an interest in writing.
He served as the sports editor for his high
school newspaper and later at the University
of Washington wrote for the student newspaper
and for Seattle's <title level="j">Japanese American Courier</title>. After graduating in 1937 with a bachelor's
degree in liberal arts and a minor in
journalism, the young journalist married Alice
Tokuko Miyake and moved to Asia where
he worked as managing editor for the <title level="j">Singapore Herald</title> (1939–40) and then as a writer
for the <title level="j">Shanghai Times</title> (1940–41). With tensions
increasing between the United States
and Japan in 1941, however, Hosokawa returned
to Seattle just weeks before Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>Like most West Coast <hi rend="italic">nisei</hi> (second-generation
Japanese Americans) Hosokawa and his
family were forced from their Seattle home
by the federal government and sent to internment
camps. While being held at the
Heart Mountain Relocation Camp in Wyoming,
Hosokawa continued writing by editing
the camp newspaper. Hosokawa was released
in 1943 and took a job in Iowa as a copy editor
for the <title level="j">Des Moines Register</title>. In 1946 he moved
his family to the Great Plains, where he began
a long career with the <title level="j">Denver Post</title>. Throughout
his newspaper career there he held a variety
of positions: war correspondent in Korea
(1950) and Vietnam (1964), associate editor
(1963–77), editorial page editor (1977–83),
and columnist (1983–92). Hosokawa also
taught journalism at the University of Northern
Colorado, University of Colorado, and
University of Wyoming.</p>

<p>Hosokawa has written several important
books on the Japanese American experience.
His most important works include <title level="m">Nisei: The Quiet Americans</title> (1969) and <title level="m"><hi rend="smallcaps">JACL</hi> in Quest of
Justice</title> (1982), both of which chronicle the history
of the Japanese American Citizens League
and its quest for redress for internment during
World War II. He also coauthored <title level="m">They Call Me Moses Masaoka</title> (1987) with Mike Masaoka,
the leader of the <hi rend="smallcaps">JACL</hi>. Hosokawa has won
awards from the Colorado Society of Professional
Journalists (1976) and the Denver Press
Club (1985), and in 1990 he received an honorary
doctorate from the University of Denver.
Hosokawa is retired and lives in Denver.</p>
