<p>Oklahoma City, like San Francisco and Denver,
was an instant city. On the morning of
April 22, 1889, the future site of the town was
an unbroken level prairie lying in a loop of the
North Canadian River; by that evening between
6,000 and 10,000 people populated the
site. Unlike the people who settled San Francisco
and Denver, however, the settlers of
Oklahoma City were not lured by the promise
of precious metals. Rather, it was the lure of
land and the promise of future prosperity that
made Oklahoma City a boomtown. The land
had belonged to the Creeks and the Seminoles,
but in 1889 the United States acquired
title to the "Unassigned District," and on
April 22 of that year the land was opened for
homestead settlement in the first of a series of
"runs."</p>

<p>Oklahoma City would become the largest
urban center and the most important trade
headquarters in central Oklahoma. After 1895,
Oklahoma City was served by four railroads,
which enabled local wholesale merchants to
extend their trade areas. Easy transportation
also facilitated the growth of flour and cottonseed
oil mills. In May 1909 representatives of
the Chicago packing firm of Nelson, Moriss
and Company met with a large number of
Oklahoma City businessmen to consider the
possibility of constructing a packing plant.
The businessmen offered a cash bonus of
$300,000 and property concessions, and the
company built the plant. A second packing
plant soon followed. By 1910 these two plants
and the attendant holding yards employed
more than 4,000 people. In 1910 Oklahoma
City became the permanent state capital,
which also provided employment for many
city residents. The village had quickly grown
into a city of 64,000, and much of the impetus
for growth had come from dynamic early
leaders such as Charles Colcord, Henry Overholser,
Hugh M. Johnson, Anton H. Classen,
and E. K. Gaylord.</p>

<p>Stimulated by World War I, Oklahoma City
boomed, and by 1920 the population had increased
to 91,295. The metropolitan area contained
400 manufacturing plants, a similar
number of jobbing houses, and 1,100 retail establishments.
After World War I the economy
became increasingly diversified: the city continued
to serve as a processing center for agricultural
products, but there were also new
iron and steel plants and factories producing
furniture, clothing, and electrical equipment.
Various large utility companies and brokerage
houses established their headquarters in the
downtown area, and, most significantly, in the
late 1920s a gusher oil field was discovered and
developed on the east side of the city. This
discovery led to an oil boom that would make
Oklahoma City a leading center of the nation's
petroleum industry.</p>

<p>The Great Depression had a chilling impact
on Oklahoma's two primary economic activities,
agriculture and oil. The crisis was so deep
that the chamber of commerce advised residents
not to invite their relatives or friends to
move to the city unless they had a job, and in
1931 the community budget allocated $338,092
of its $450,565 for relief activities. However,
although the Depression slowed economic
growth in Oklahoma City, it did not stop
it: more than 367 new businesses were established
in 1931 alone.</p>

<p>But again it was war&#8211;World War II&#8211;that
stimulated growth. Led by business and civic
leaders R. A. Singletary, Stanley Draper, Samuel
W. Hays, Frank Buttram, Harvey P. Everest,
and Dan Hogan, Oklahoma City secured
Tinker Air Force Base. By the 1970s Tinker was
the city's and the state's largest single employer,
with some 22,500 civilian workers and
about 3,000 air force personnel and an annual
payroll of almost $300 million. Along with
further economic development in iron and
steel and the electronics industry, Oklahoma
City also expanded physically in the 1960s.
The city annexed a large number of surrounding
areas, increasing in size from about 310
square miles in 1960 to about 635 square miles
in 1970. Its population continued to grow,
reaching 403,484 in 1980.</p>

<p>Unlike many cities in the 1960s, Oklahoma
City was not rocked by violent social upheavals.
Clara Luper, sponsor of the naacp Youth
Organization, led a generally peaceful sit-in
movement that integrated most restaurants
and other public facilities in the late 1950s.
Integration of Oklahoma City schools by busing
in the 1960s, however, did create turmoil
and protest.</p>

<p>In the 1970s and early 1980s Oklahoma City
reaped the economic and social benefits of a
growing oil industry and the construction of a
General Motors plant. Unfortunately, the collapse
of Penn Square Bank and problems in
the oil industry slowed city growth for much
of the 1980s. On April 19, 1995, Oklahoma City
gained prominence that it did not want when
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was
bombed and destroyed, killing 168 people. In
2000 the population of Oklahoma City proper
was 450,000, with more than one million people
living in the entire metropolitan statistical
area.</p>
