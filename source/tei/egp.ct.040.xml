<head type="main">RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA</head>

<p>Rapid City is located in southwestern South
Dakota on the eastern edge of the Black Hills.
Incorporated in 1882, the city is the county
seat of Pennington County. During the Black
Hills gold rush Rapid City flourished as a
commercial center. In 1886 Rapid City became
the first city in the region serviced by a railroad,
guaranteeing its survival. The darkest
day in the history of the city came on June 9,
1972, when heavy rains caused flash floods that
killed over 200 people. In 2000 Rapid City's
population was 59,607.</p>

<p>By 1880 the Black Hills gold rush had
waned, and cattle ranching became the primary
economic activity; its importance to the
local economy has continued into the twentyfirst
century. Rapid City also serves the surrounding
area as a trade and transportation
center for ranching, agriculture, lumbering,
and mining. The Bureau of Reclamation's
Rapid Valley irrigation project has enhanced
agricultural productivity. Major minerals
mined or quarried in the area include gold,
silver, uranium, mica, limestone, sand and
gravel, and gemstones. Manufacturing activities
in this rapidly growing city include flour
milling, dairy and meat products, wood millwork,
wooden furniture, gun stocks, small
arms ammunition, gold and silver jewelry,
uniform manufacturing, circuit boards, construction
materials, steel fabrication, packaging,
concrete, and limestone products. Banking
and finance are also major economic
activities.</p>

<p>The invention of the automobile and President
Calvin Coolidge's popularization of the
Black Hills brought tourists to the region.
Rapid City is the gateway to numerous Black
Hills attractions, including Mount Rushmore
National Memorial, Wind Cave National Park,
Devils Tower National Monument, Badlands
National Park, and Jewel Cave National Monument.
Other local tourist attractions include
the Black Hills National Forest, Custer State
Park, Crazy Horse Monument, the Sturgis
Motorcycle Rally, and the town of Deadwood.
Rapid City is also home to The Journey, a major
museum complex that houses the South
Dakota Museum of Geology, the Sioux Indian
Museum, the Archaeological Research Center,
the Minnilusa Pioneer Museum, and the
Duhamel Collection.</p>

<p>Rapid City is served by the Rapid City Regional
Airport, the Dakota, Minnesota, and
Eastern Railroad, U.S. Highways 14 and 16,
and Interstate 90. Ellsworth Air Force Base,
located northeast of the city, is a major air
command installation and a significant source
of employment. Educational institutions include
the South Dakota School of Mines
and Technology, the National American University,
and the Western Dakota Technical
Institute.</p>
