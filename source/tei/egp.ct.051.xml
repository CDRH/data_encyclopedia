<head type="main">TOPEKA, KANSAS</head>

<p>Overland transportation was key to the origins
and development of Topeka. When Kansas
Territory opened for settlement in 1854,
the banks of the Kansas River attracted permanent
residents some sixty miles above its
mouth. There a military road connecting Fort
Leavenworth and the Santa Fe Trail crossed
the Oregon Trail. But more than geography
explained the city's development. The nine
men who jointly founded Topeka on December
5, 1854, shared a desire to profit from
town-lot speculation and a bias against slavery
spreading to the Central Great Plains. As a
result, Topeka came to represent the free-state
side in the violence that made "Bleeding Kansas"
the prologue to the Civil War.</p>

<p>After territorial fights over slavery were resolved
in Topeka's favor, civic leaders made
the city a political center, both as a county seat
and the new capital, when Kansas gained statehood
early in 1861. They also worked to make
their frontier village a commercial center by
tapping into the national expansion of railroads.
The first Union Pacific train reached
Topeka on New Year's Day, 1866. Subsequently,
Cyrus K. Holliday, an original town founder,
organized the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe
Railroad in 1868 and began laying tracks to the
southwest, ultimately extending the city's connections
to the Pacific.</p>

<p>Jobs created by processing regional agricultural
products such as meatpacking and flour
milling as well as building and repairing rail
rolling stock stimulated population growth.
Two additional railroads, the Rock Island and
the Missouri Pacific, arrived in the 1880s. With
the influx of German immigrants from Russia
and Freedmen fleeing worsening conditions
in the South, Topeka became an economically
dynamic and ethnically diverse city.</p>

<p>International recognition for the city came
in 1897 when Charles M. Sheldon published
<title level="m">In His Steps</title>, an influential Christian social
novel. In the early twentieth century, Samuel J.
Crumbine pioneered public health reform.
That tradition would be enriched when Dr.
C. F. Menninger and his two sons opened the
Menninger Clinic in 1920 and the Menninger
Sanitarium in 1925 and made Topeka a worldfamous
center for the study of psychiatry.</p>

<p>Natural disasters&#8211;floods in 1903 and 1951
and a tornado in 1966&#8211;rearranged land-use
patterns, while mobilization for World War II
brought new industries to the city's periphery.
Postwar annexations and suburban housing
developments pushed city limits outward.
With the beginnings of the interstate highway
system, I-70 cut a swath through the middle
of Topeka in the 1960s, prompting urban renewal
activities that displaced business from
the downtown to the suburbs.</p>

<p>Local efforts to challenge racial segregation
again brought national attention when in 1954
the case of <title>Brown v. The Board of Education</title> of
Topeka initiated school integration throughout
the nation. State government's expansion
in the 1960s assured that Topeka's population
would remain stable at about 120,000 for the
balance of the century. By the century's end,
the Kansas state capital had become a western
edge city for the Kansas City bistate metropolitan
area.</p>
