<head type="main">WICHITA, KANSAS</head>

<p>From a trading and hunting outpost of 600
people when it emerged as an incorporated
town from the former Osage reservation in
1870, Wichita prospered through changes, reinvented
itself often, and served, by the turn
of the twenty-first century, a metropolitan
area of 500,000 people. It was by turns, and
among other things, the premier cattle town
of Kansas (1870s), the fastest growing city
in the United States (1880s), the broomcorn-jobbing
capital of the nation (1910s), the "Air
Capital of the World" (1920s), a major defense
manufacturing center (1940s), an entrepreneurial
incubator for fast food franchises and
other businesses (1950s and 1960s), and a regional
center for medical care and research
(1970s and 1980s).</p>

<p>Like many Plains cities, Wichita's strength
has been in the energy and vision of its people.
Joseph McCoy organized the cattle trade
there. Marshall Murdock of the Wichita Eagle
attracted attention by calling his hometown
the "New Memphis of the American Nile" and
the "Peerless Princess of the Plains." Mary E.
Lease formed her Populist rhetorical style
in local debates. Carrie Nation made national
headlines by discovering that Wichita was not
respecting the Kansas prohibition ordinance.
William Coleman's Wichita gasoline lantern
plant made his name a household word. A. A.
Hyde invented Mentholatum, the "little nurse
for little ills," in Wichita. Matty Laird, Walter
Beech, Lloyd Stearman, Clyde Cessna, and
William Lear were only some of those who
made aviation history there. Wichita was
an early leader in government innovation
through establishing a city commission (1909)
and a city manager system (1917). Even earlier
(1887), the town had extended the municipal
franchise to women. Paul Wellman was a
popular western historian. Louise Brooks of
Wichita became a major movie star. Frank
and Dan Carney founded Pizza Hut in a small
brick building in Wichita in 1958. Sam Ramey
took his Wichita State education on to international
opera stardom. Runner Jim Ryun
broke the four-minute mile in high school and
must surely be ranked as the nation's all-time
greatest miler. Nancy Kassebaum pioneered
among women in the Senate.</p>

<p>Wichita seemed to learn from its reverses.
In the 1890s it lost one-third of its population
and one-half of its valuation yet attracted aviation
and other industries in the early twentieth
century to grow again. During the Great
Depression, although its population stabilized
at 100,000, local people preserved the aircraft
business, and, with that industry as a base,
World War II contracting led to a doubling of
the population within a decade.</p>

<p>In the late twentieth century Wichita became
more diverse&#8211;in population, in business,
and in social and cultural focus&#8211;than it
had been traditionally. During World War II
its lack of Asian residents had been an argument
for making it a defense center, and the
black population was never over 5 percent until
the 1960s. That changed, and in 2000 Asians
and African Americans constituted, respectively,
4 percent and 11.4 percent of the city's
population. Wichita has three times in recent
decades been recognized as an All-American
City in national competition, reflecting its
cultural resources, clean environment, and
continuing entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
