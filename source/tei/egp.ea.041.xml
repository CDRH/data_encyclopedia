<head type="main">VILLASUR, PEDRO DE (ca. late seventeenth century-1720)</head>

<p>Don Pedro de Villasur, a Spanish government
official and military officer, led a disastrous expedition
north into modern Nebraska in 1720.
Born a Castilian nobleman in the late seventeenth
century, he died on August 13, 1720, in a
battle against Pawnee and Otoe Indians. In the
early eighteenth century he reached the Americas,
where he became a sublieutenant at El
Paso, then later a war captain and alcalde
at Santa Barbara, Nueva Vizcaya. By 1719 he
had risen to be lieutenant governor of New
Mexico. To find out what their French rivals
planned to the north, Governor Antonio Valverde
de Cosio sent Villasur, an inexperienced
officer, on a reconnaissance mission.</p>

<p>The expedition, consisting of forty-two veteran
soldiers, three settlers, sixty Pueblo Natives,
chaplain Juan Minguez, chief scout Jose
Naranjo, and interpreter Jean L'Archeveque,
set out on June 16, 1720, from the Santa Fe
presidio. They crossed the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains, then moved north to modern
Pueblo, Colorado. From there they pushed
across the Plains of eastern Colorado to the
South Platte River, which they followed to the
Platte and down into what is now eastern Nebraska.
There, Villasur sent a captive Pawnee
to parley at a nearby village.</p>

<p>Negotiations with the Pawnees collapsed after
two days. The other officers convinced Villasur
that the situation had reached a crisis,
and they retreated fifty miles upstream to the
Loup River near modern-day Columbus, Nebraska.
That night the sentries heard noises
in the dark, but Villasur responded only by
sending Pueblos to look around. In the early
morning of August 13, 1720, while the groggy
Spanish rounded up their horses, a united
band of Pawnees and Otoes attacked. Most of
the Pueblos escaped, while the disoriented
Spaniards milled around on foot and fell victim
to the attackers' musket fire. Thirteen soldiers
and one settler managed to escape, but
they left behind forty-five dead, including
eleven Pueblos and thirty-two Spaniards, Villasur
among them. All the survivors were
wounded, but the attackers themselves had
suffered so heavily that they could not give
chase.</p>

<p>Subsequently, many Spaniards seriously
questioned Valverde's decision to allow an inexperienced
lieutenant such as Villasur to lead
such an important mission, blaming this officer's
mistakes in leadership for the massacre.
Valverde was found guilty of negligence by a
court of inquiry but had only to pay a small
fine. Despite its tragic end, Villasur's expedition
remains important because it was the
most northerly penetration by the Spanish
into North America and the only Spanish incursion
into Nebraska.</p>
