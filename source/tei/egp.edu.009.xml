<head type="main">CANADIAN PLAINS RESEARCH CENTER</head>

<p>The Canadian Plains Research Center (<hi rend="smallcaps">CPRC</hi>)
is the longest serving research institute at
the University of Regina, Saskatchewan, with a
broad mandate to develop an understanding
and appreciation of the Canadian Plains region.
The center also cooperates with U.S.
scholars on issues relevant to the broader
North American Great Plains.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">CPRC</hi> works to develop a community of students
of the region, including staff from Prairie
universities, governments, and other institutions
and members of an interested public;
to provide services to Prairie institutions and
researchers; to study and help solve problems
of the region, its people, and its resources; and
to initiate, undertake, encourage, and support
research and scholarly work on all aspects of
Prairie life.</p>

<p>The center delivers four specific programs.
The Canadian Plains Studies Program is a
graduate program that facilitates the interdisciplinary
studies of students pursuing their
masters and doctorates on topics relevant to
the Canadian Plains. More than thirty-five
students have been supported through the
program. The Research Fellow Program, established
in 1983, has provided support to
more than forty scholars conducting research
relevant to the Canadian Plains. The Publication
Division is a university press, established
in 1973, that publishes eight to ten scholarly
books per year, with a total of more than 130
titles. The press also publishes <hi rend="italic">Prairie Forum</hi>,
a multidisciplinary journal on topics of relevance
to the Canadian Plains region. Finally,
the Geographic Information Systems Division
is a group of research and technical staff and
facilities that support education and research
in the spatial distribution of resources, both
physical and cultural.</p>

<p>As part of its original and continuing education
and community outreach mandate, the
cprc also organizes, facilitates, and partners
with other organizations in delivering
numerous conferences, symposia, workshops,
lectures, meetings, and seminars. The cprc
also presents the Woodrow Lloyd Occasional
Seminar Series, in which leading scholars
present topics relevant to the Canadian Plains,
and administers a trust fund dedicated to advancing
communication and education about
conservation issues in Saskatchewan.</p>
