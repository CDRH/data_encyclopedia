<p>Indian boarding schools, a primary focus of
federal Indian policy beginning in the late
1870s, were designed as instruments for the
assimilation of Native Americans into American
society and were established on and off
reservations throughout the United States, especially
in the Great Plains. Boarding schools
first appeared on reservations in 1877, but, beginning
in 1879, policy makers seeking higher
potential for assimilation channeled their efforts
into building them off the reservations.
By 1900 officials had reversed their decision,
disturbed by the high costs associated with
these schools, and, until 1923, they renewed
support for on-reservation boarding and day
schools. In 1923 pressure from Indian rights
activists led the government to decrease its
role in Indian education and, with the passage
of the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934, to
withdraw even further.</p>

<p>From the early nineteenth century, philanthropists
and political leaders promoted
assimilation through education as the most
humane approach to the "Indian problem."
Education was initially left to missionaries
and philanthropists, who, with the support of
church denominations and the government's
"civilization" fund, established schools along
with missions among Plains Indians during
the 1830s. Mission schools remained an important
component of Indian education—and
assimilation—policy throughout the century,
though they declined in importance after 1873,
when direct federal financial support was removed.
The federal government did, however,
continue to contract with religious denominations
to support mission schools, but their
era was over.</p>

<p>The federal government moved to fill the
gap. In 1870 Congress initiated an annual appropriation
of $100,000 for Indian education.
By 1893 the annual appropriation had risen to
$2.3 million. The bulk of the money went to
establishing day schools on or near Indian villages
and later on reservations. By 1870 48 day
schools were in operation, and the number
had risen to 147 by 1900; the majority were on
reservations in the Great Plains.</p>

<p>But reformers were not entirely satisfied
with day schools. The reservation environment,
to which the child returned daily, undermined
the process of assimilation. By the
end of the 1870s policy makers were promoting
reservation boarding schools as a solution
to the shortcomings of the day schools; they
viewed these schools&#8211;and the resultant separation
of Indian children from their families&#8211;
as a superior context for changing children's
attitudes, values, and habits. Like the day
schools, which still received support, the majority
of reservation boarding schools were
built in the Great Plains.</p>

<p>As the idea of reservation boarding schools
took hold, so too did the idea of federally operated
schools off reservations. These schools
followed the model of Richard Henry Pratt's
Carlisle Indian Industrial School, founded in
Pennsylvania in 1879, with an initial enrollment
recruited from the Plains. The children
received instruction in academic subjects (English,
arithmetic, and geography) and also
worked on manual labor projects. Boys labored in the fields, in construction, and in the
blacksmith's shop; girls were taught to cook,
clean, and sew. The objectives were to instill a
work ethic, individualism, and other tenets of
American civilization and to suppress all that
was Indian.</p>

<p>Federal off-reservation boarding schools
first appeared in the Great Plains in 1884 with
the opening of Chilocco in Indian Territory
near the Kansas border, Genoa in Nebraska,
and Haskell in Lawrence, Kansas. Plans were
soon under way to expand further. Pratt had
urged o.cials to build off-reservation schools
only in completely white communities, as far
away from reservation influence as possible,
but policy makers were concerned about the
cost of transporting Indian children long distances.
To save money they decided to build
schools closer to the reservations, and in 1882
congressional authorization to use vacated
military buildings reinforced this decision.</p>

<p>By the end of the 1880s seven federal off-
reservation boarding schools were in operation
nationally, enrolling more than 1,800 Indian
children. In the 1890s eighteen more were
built, including those at Pierre, Flandreau,
Chamberlain, and Rapid City, South Dakota.
By the end of the century there were also
forty-three reservation boarding schools on
the Plains and sixty-seven day schools. The
on-reservation boarding schools were mainly
located in North and South Dakota and Indian
Territory; South Dakota, with its eight
reservations and large Indian population, had
the bulk of the day schools.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm for federal off-reservation
boarding schools quickly faded after the turn
of the twentieth century. In 1901 Commissioner
of Indian Affairs William Jones expressed
alarm that $45 million spent on 20,000
Indian children had produced little evidence
of assimilation. His 1904 annual report emphasized
the necessity of utilizing existing reservation
boarding and day schools more effectively.
Arguing that these schools were no less
effective than the off-reservation schools for
assimilation, Jones proposed a hierarchy of existing
schools that would provide the greatest
opportunity for assimilating the best students
with the greatest potential for surviving in the
white world.</p>

<p>The building phase was over. Thereafter,
Indian education policy deemphasized off-
reservation schools. Policy makers argued that
Indians were incapable of (more accurately,
resistant to) the rapid assimilation envisioned
by Pratt and noted that most Indians educated
in the system of schools returned to the reservation.
With this shift in emphasis, the number
of boarding schools began to decline, and
by 1920 seven of the federal off-reservation
schools, including the flagship Carlisle as well
as Chamberlain, had closed.</p>

<p>By the 1920s the long-lasting and unsuccessful
assimilation policy was in decline. John
Collier's American Indian Defense Association,
founded in 1923, worked for the next
decade to change the focus of federal Indian
policy from destruction of Native cultures to
respect for individual Indian self-identity. Collier
became commissioner of Indian Affairs in
1933. In 1934 the passage of the Wheeler-
Howard Indian Reorganization Act established
a "New Deal" for Native Americans,
providing for tribal landownership, self-government,
control of Indian education, and the
closing of many of the remaining federal off-
reservation boarding schools. The Great Plains
education map is now dotted with reservation
community day schools, Bureau of Indian Affairs
postsecondary schools (for example,
Haskell Indian Junior College), and tribally
controlled community colleges such as Sinte
Gleska on Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota,
the first Indian-run college to offer bachelor's
degrees. The off-reservation boarding
schools at Flandreau and Pierre, however, continue
to operate.</p>
