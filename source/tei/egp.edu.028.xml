<p>There are more than 1,000 museums in the
Great Plains, and they tell many stories&#8211;how
the region was formed, the history of its Indigenous
inhabitants, the process of exploration
and settlement by immigrants.</p>

<p>The center of the continent is marked by
the Geographical Center Historical Museum
(Rugby, North Dakota), in the heart of the
Great Plains. Some museums document the
big changes in the region. The Royal Tyrrell
Museum of Paleontology (Drumheller, Alberta)
presents a vivid picture of evolution in
the Great Plains, from bacteria to dinosaurs.
The changes wrought by western agricultural
practices are depicted in the Cattle Raisers
Museum (Fort Worth, Texas), the Canadian
National Historic Windmill Centre (Etzikom,
Alberta), and the National Agricultural Center
and Hall of Fame (Bonner Springs, Kansas).
The Gem of the West Museum (Coaldale,
Alberta) tells the interrelated story of irrigation
and European settlement. Museums devoted
to the settlers include trail sites, sod
houses, historic buildings, pioneer villages,
and shrines to cowboys and farmers. The
Great Plains is dotted with historic forts and
military museums, including the Fort Casper
Museum (Casper, Wyoming), the Fort Concho
National Historic Landmark (San Angelo,
Texas), and the Little Bighorn Battlefield National
Monument (Crow Agency, Montana).
In Oberlin, Kansas, the Last Indian Raid Museum
commemorates the last battle between
settlers and Native Americans in the state
(in 1878); the French Legation Museum (Austin,
Texas) recalls Texas as a French colony.
Cowboy museums include the National Cowboy
Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center
(Oklahoma City, Oklahoma), the Boot
Hill Museum (Dodge City, Kansas), and the
Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame and Museum of
the American Cowboy (Colorado Springs,
Colorado).</p>

<p>Museums devoted to the ethnic heritage of
Great Plains inhabitants include El Museo Latino
and the Great Plains Black Museum
(Omaha, Nebraska), the National Hall of
Fame for Famous American Indians (Anadarko,
Oklahoma), and the Seminole Nation
Museum (Wewoka, Oklahoma). The
Trembowla Cross of Freedom, Inc., Museum
(Dauphin, Manitoba) celebrates the first
Ukrainian settlement in North America. The
Calgary Chinese Cultural Centre and the Beth
Tzedec Heritage Collection (a Jewish museum)
are in Calgary, Alberta.</p>

<p>Other museums interpret modern agents of
change. Chevyland U.S.A. (Elm Creek, Nebraska)
features a working collection of all
Chevrolet models. The petroleum industry is
the subject of the Norman #1 Museum in Neodesha,
Kansas (site of the first commercial oil
well west of the Mississippi) and the Iraan Museum
(in Alley Oop Fantasy Land Park, Iraan,
Texas). The rise of suburbia is detailed in the
Johnson County Museum (Shawnee, Kansas).
The museum's collection includes a fully furnished
all-electric house from the 1950s, with
reenactors portraying family members.</p>

<p>Great Plains museums also record the
changes in particular places that have shaped
local history. There are hundreds of small museums and historic sites such as the Grant
County Museum (Elgin, North Dakota) and
the Rocky Ford Historical Museum (Rocky
Ford, Colorado), often run entirely by volunteer
labor. These institutions preserve local
heritage. In all, about 77 percent of Great
Plains museums are history museums, historic
sites, and general museums devoted to
one place or region. Some are comprehensive
institutions with large-scale exhibitions, collections,
archives, and conservation facilities
such as the Kansas Museum of History (Topeka,
Kansas), the Nebraska State Museum
(Lincoln, Nebraska), and the Panhandle-
Plains Historical Museum (Canyon, Texas).
Most history museums are smaller, such as the
Middle Border Museum of American Indian
and Pioneer Life (Mitchell, South Dakota)
and the Otoe County Museum of Memories
(Syracuse, Nebraska). The Tsa Mo Ga Memorial
Museum (Plains, Texas) receives only
about thirty visitors a year.</p>

<p>Several Great Plains museums are known
worldwide as research institutions. Among
these are the Natural History Museum and
Biodiversity Research Center at the University
of Kansas (Lawrence, Kansas), the Joslyn Art
Museum (Omaha, Nebraska), and the Kimbell
Art Museum (Fort Worth, Texas). About
8 percent of Great Plains museums are art museums.
Another 3 percent focus on natural
history, 2 percent are devoted exclusively
to Native Americans, and 4 percent are zoos
or botanical gardens. Specialized museums
(7 percent) include the World Figure Skating
Museum and Hall of Fame (Colorado Springs,
Colorado) and Big Well, a museum about the
world's largest hand-dug well (Greensburg,
Kansas). The Parade of Presidents Wax Museum
is in Keystone, South Dakota.</p>

<p>Although most museums are federal, state,
or local nonprofit institutions, some are private
tax-exempt corporations. These may
be largeâ€”the Harold Warp Pioneer Village
Foundation (Minden, Nebraska) numbers
among its collections at least 350 cars, 50,000
historical items, and a Norman Rockwell collection.
Most are smaller and more modest in
scope such as the Galloping Road Compound
and Poker Alley at Harbor Ranch (Dripping
Springs, Texas).</p>

<p>The Great Plains has museums devoted to
famous people. Two museums honor former
president Dwight Eisenhower, the Eisenhower
Birthplace State Historical Park (Denison,
Texas) and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library
and Museum (Abilene, Kansas). Others include
the Dalton Defenders Museum (Coffeyville,
Kansas), the Buddy Holly Center (Lubbock,
Texas), the Billy the Kid Museum (Fort
Sumner, New Mexico), and the Jim Thorpe
Home (Yale, Oklahoma). The Emmett Kelly
Historical Museum is in Sedan, Kansas; the
Will Rogers Memorial is in Claremore, Oklahoma;
the Martin and Osa Johnson Safari
Museum, Inc., is in Chanute, Kansas; and the
O. Henry House and Museum is in Austin,
Texas.</p>

<p>The spirit of Willa Cather thrives in museums.
Her childhood home (the Willa Cather
State Historic Site) and other locations in Red
Cloud, Nebraska, invoke her writings. The
stories of her immigrant characters are told
in diverse places such as the Museum of the
American Historical Society of Germans from
Russia (Lincoln, Nebraska) and the Wilber
Museum (Wilber, Nebraska).</p>

<p>Some Great Plains museums feature decidedly
singular pursuits. These include the
Enchanted World Doll Museum (Mitchell,
South Dakota) and the National Museum
of Woodcarving (Custer, South Dakota).
Turner's Curling Museum (Weyburn, Saskatchewan)
has a collection of 3,800 curling
pins. The National Museum of Roller Skating
(Lincoln, Nebraska) exhibits skates from 1819
to the present.</p>

<p>A few museums are monuments to American
eccentricity, including the Garden of
Eden, a house built from limestone logs surrounded
by an allegorical sculpture garden
(Lucas, Kansas). The Robert L. More Bird Egg
Collection (Vernon, Texas) houses 10,000 bird
eggs. The Great Plains is the birthplace of
Kool-Aid, which is depicted in an exhibit in
the Hastings Museum (Hastings, Nebraska).
This is a big museum in a small community,
with three floors of exhibits and an imax theater.
The museum's founder is buried in the
basement.</p>

<p>Among the most specialized Great Plains
museums are the Museum of Independent
Telephony and the Greyhound Hall of Fame
(both in Abilene, Kansas) as well as the Boys
Town Hall of History (Boys Town, Nebraska).
There is America's Shrine to Music Museum
(Vermillion, South Dakota), the William A.
Quayle Bible Collection at Baker University
(Baldwin, Kansas), and the Strategic Air
Command Museum (Ashland, Nebraska).
The Soukup and Thomas International Balloon
and Airship Museum is in Mitchell,
South Dakota; the Appaloosa Horse Club Senior
Citizens Museum and Archives can be
found in Claresholm, Alberta.</p>

<p>What all of these museums have in common
is their commitment to study, preserve,
and exhibit real things, be they hubcaps, projectile
points, fossil sea urchins, or rubber
horseshoes. A museum gives its audience a
sense of place and purpose. Museums interpret
the past to inform the future.</p>
