<p>Tommy Lee Jones, who was born to workingclass
parents in the small central Texas town of
San Saba on September 15, 1946, has the looks
(his face appears to have been chiseled by a
dusty Plains wind) and real experience of cattle
country that surely would have made him a
hero of Westerns had not that genre faded before
he became a star (his role in the television
movie <title>Lonesome Dove</title> [1988] proves this
point). Instead, he has become a popular, accomplished,
not-quite-leading man in a diverse
array of films, including his complex portrayal
of murderer Gary Gilmore in <title>The Executioner's Song</title> (1982), his inventive character
study of Clay Shaw in <title><hi rend="smallcaps">JFK</hi></title> (1992), and his
tongue-in-cheek performances in Hollywood
action movies like <title>Men in Black</title> (1997).</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Jones is a fine actor
who through small gestures can make his characters
real, and he was honored as such with a
best supporting actor Academy Award for his
role as Gerard in <title>The Fugitive</title> (1994). Yet part
of his appeal is that he doesn't seem to take
himself seriously. A cum laude graduate in English
from Harvard (where he also played football
and roomed with Al Gore), he nevertheless
still locates "home" as "somewhere
between Texas and Mexico"; he likes to play
polo, but he also raises cattle on a ranch near
San Saba; and he credits his Texas upbringing
with giving him the work ethic that carried
him through thirty-three feature films by 1998.</p>
