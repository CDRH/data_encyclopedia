<p>One of the greatest creators of American silent
film comedy, Keaton was born Joseph Frank
Keaton in Piqua, Kansas, on October 4, 1895.
His father, Joe Keaton, migrated from Indiana
to Oklahoma during the land boom of 1889
but soon abandoned homesteading to perform
eccentric dances for Frank Cutler's Medicine
Show. There Joe met Cutler's daughter
Myra, who also performed in the show. In
1894 Joe married Myra and launched his own
medicine show in partnership with Harry
Houdini, who allegedly suggested the younger
Keaton's nickname, Buster.</p>

<p>According to legend, one day while his parents
were performing in Kansas shortly before
Buster's third birthday, Buster suffered three
alarming accidents. First he caught his hand
in a clothes wringer, mangling the tip of his
right index finger, which had to be amputated.
Later the same day, he hit himself near the
right eye with a rock while trying to knock a
peach out of a tree. Still later, he was sucked
out of a window by a tornado, carried three
blocks, and deposited on the ground unhurt.
Concluding that Buster might be safer onstage,
Joe devised the vaudeville act known as
<title>The Three Keatons</title>, which consisted primarily
of an escalating combat between Buster, an
unruly child, and Joe, his exasperated Irish
father. As "the Human Mop," Buster entertained
audiences by tumbling and being flung
impassively around the stage, developing acrobatic
skills he later used to perform spectacular
film stunts.</p>

<p>Largely due to Buster's audience appeal,
<title>The Three Keatons</title> thrived until Joe's alcoholism
made working with him intolerable.
When the act broke up in 1917, Roscoe Arbuckle
recruited Buster to appear in a series of
short comedies for Arbuckle's Comique Film
Corporation. To Buster's surprise, the mechanics
of filmmaking fascinated him, and he
quickly mastered the new medium.</p>

<p>Keaton's greatest achievements are the
thirty-two film comedies (nineteen shorts and
thirteen features) he made, mostly for his own
company, between 1920 and 1929. These films
showcase Keaton's trademark character: an
unsmiling, hauntingly earnest young man
who becomes embroiled in a wide array of
bizarre situations, many of them involving
machines. Keaton's films are characterized by
wry humor, a touch of surrealism, and a vigorous
exploration of the possibilities and limitations
of film as a medium. Of his feature films, <title>Our Hospitality</title> (1923), <title>Sherlock, Jr.</title> (1924), <title>The Navigator</title> (1924), <title>The General</title> (1926), and <title>The Cameraman</title> (1928) are especially notable.</p>

<p>In 1928 Keaton made the critical mistake of
signing a contract with mgm. As a result, he
quickly lost control of his films, whose quality
seriously declined, while at the same time his
marital and drinking problems increased.
Fired by <hi rend="smallcaps">MGM</hi> in 1933, the tenacious Keaton
nevertheless continued to work, less prominently,
as an actor, gag writer, producer, and
director. Eventually, he remarried happily and
lived to see his films revived in the 1950s and
1960s. This rediscovery of his work brought
him renewed, even unprecedented recognition,
including a special Oscar in 1960. Buster
Keaton died of lung cancer in Woodland Hills,
California, on February 1, 1966. A small museum
in Piqua recalls Keaton's Plains origins.</p>
