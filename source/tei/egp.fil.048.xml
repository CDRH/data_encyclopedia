<p>Like her contemporary in movie stardom,
Brad Pitt, Demi Moore was born in the Great
Plains but quickly moved on. She was born
Demi Guymes on November 11, 1962, in Roswell,
New Mexico. She had a tough upbringing:
her mother and father married and divorced
twice before separating permanently
when Demi was fifteen. By her estimation, she
had lived in more than thirty different towns
by the time she was twelve. Geographic stability
came only in 1975, when she settled in
West Hollywood with her mother. At the age
of sixteen she began a career as a model, and
by the time she was twenty she was acting in
movies and the television soap opera <title>General Hospital</title>.</p>

<p>Her rise to celebrity status came with her all-too-
true-to-life role as a cocaine addict in <title>St. Elmo's Fire</title> (1985). Moore quickly overcame
her own addiction and with great ambition
and energy went on to become one of Hollywood's
most bankable stars in the 1990s. Leading
roles in <title>Ghost</title> (1990), <title>A Few Good Men</title>
(1992), and <title>Indecent Proposal</title> (1993) proved
that Moore could indeed act. Posing nude for a
Vanity Fair cover in 1991 while seven months
pregnant only added to her stardom. Her star
has, perhaps, temporarily dimmed in recent
years because of a series of unfortunate choices
of film roles (not least, <title>Striptease</title> in 1996).</p>

<p>An intelligent woman with strong ideas of
her own (she has been labeled "difficult" because
of this), Moore was initially married to
rock musician Freddy Moore and was later in
a long relationship with Emilio Estevez. In
1987 she married actor Bruce Willis, with
whom she has three children. They divorced
in 1998.</p>
