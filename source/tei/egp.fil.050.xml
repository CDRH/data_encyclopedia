<p>Born in Omaha, Nebraska, on February 8,
1941, Nick Nolte was a star athlete in high
school who won a football scholarship to Arizona
State University. Over the next several
years he drifted in and out of numerous college
programs before abandoning plans for a
professional football career.</p>

<p>While studying at the Pasadena Playhouse,
Nolte came to the attention of a drama coach
who encouraged him to study at Stella Adler's
Academy. Believing that the coasts were over-populated
with talented actors, Nolte sought
opportunities to develop his acting skills
with various regional theater companies. He
worked for more than a decade with companies
in Denver, Chicago, and Minneapolis.
After a few minor television roles in the early
1970s, Nolte landed the pivotal role of his career
(<title>Rich Man, Poor Man</title>, <hi rend="smallcaps">ABC</hi> [1976]), which
garnered him an Emmy nomination.</p>

<p>Hollywood noticed his phenomenal audience
appeal, and Nolte began regular film
work. Although much in demand as a romantic
lead (<title>The Deep</title>, 1977; <title>Prince of Tides</title>, 1991),
Nick Nolte has almost always shunned purely
commercial fare in favor of roles that examine
the darker, more troubling elements of the human
spirit. As a result, he is more often seen as
a complex and often threatening antagonist (<title>Q&amp;A</title>, 1990) than a romantic leading man. Even
his more romantic turns (as in <title>Afterglow</title>, 1997)
examine a tortured psyche with enormous
depth and realism.</p>

<p>One of the most physically intense and
emotionally eloquent contemporary American
actors, Nolte continues to produce critically
acclaimed performances (<title>Affliction</title>, 1998;
<title>The Thin Red Line</title>, 1999).</p>
