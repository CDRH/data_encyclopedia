<p><title>Oklahoma!</title> (directed by Fred Zinneman) was
one of the most popular films of the 1950s.
The musical, written by Richard Rodgers and
Oscar Hammerstein, was based on Lynn
Riggs's Broadway play, <title>Green Grow the Lilacs</title>.
The musical was adapted into a movie in 1955.</p>

<p>The story takes place in Indian Territory
(later Oklahoma) during the early 1900s and
concerns the rivalry between a cowboy, Curly,
and a ranch hand, Jud Frye, for the love of an
Oklahoma farm girl, Laurie Williams. While
the 1943 Broadway musical was a success for
Rodgers and Hammerstein, the film version,
starring Shirley Jones (Laurie), Gordon Mac-
Rae (Curly), and Rod Steiger (Jud Frye), made
<title>Oklahoma!</title> an overnight sensation. The film
version also included performances by Gloria
Grahame, Eddie Albert, and Charlotte Greenwood.
Revolutionary for its time, the musical
incorporated plot, music, and dance, with
choreography by Agnes De Mille. The score of
<title>Oklahoma!</title> also proved highly popular, including
songs such as "Oh, What a Beautiful
Mornin'," "The Surrey with the Fringe on
Top," "I Can't Say No," and "People Will Say
We're in Love." The title song, "Oklahoma,"
became the official state song. Although the
musical presented an idealized story of life on
the Plains frontier, the film version was actually
shot in Arizona. The film won Academy
Awards for best score, best editing, and best
sound as well as nominations for best film and
cinematography. In 1955 the New York Film
Critics Circle named <title>Oklahoma!</title> the year's
best film.</p>
