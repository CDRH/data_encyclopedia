<p><title>Soldier Blue</title> (1970), directed by Ralph Nelson,
is loosely based on <title>Arrow in the Sun</title> (1969), a
novel by Theodore Victor Olsen (1932–93), a
Wisconsin-born freelance writer of nearly
four dozen Western sagas, including the best-sellers
<title>The Stalking Moon</title> (1965) and <title>Red Is the River</title> (1983). As in the film, the novel centers
on the fictitious characters of Private Honus
Gant, a former schoolteacher from Ohio
turned army trooper, and Cresta Marybelle
Lee, a young woman from Boston who, while
en route to marry an army lieutenant posted
on the frontier some years earlier, is captured
by a band of Cheyennes and becomes the second
wife of the band's leader, Spotted Wolf.
After escaping from the Cheyennes, Lee accompanies
an army paymaster's detail that includes
Private Gant to Fort Reunion, where
her fiancé is stationed. When the paymaster's
detail is ambushed and wiped out by Spotted
Wolf 's band, Gant and Lee, the sole survivors,
are forced to try to make it to Fort Reunion on
their own. They never do, as their fates become
linked to Colonel Iverson's brutal attack on
Spotted Wolf 's village, which brings the film to
a brutal, horrifying, and surreal climax.</p>

<p><title>Soldier Blue</title> is badly flawed by a glaring
anachronism, among other inaccuracies. Action
portrayed in the novel supposedly takes
place roughly in 1877, more than twelve years
after Spotted Wolf had witnessed his entire
family being murdered at Sand Creek by Col.
John M. Chivington's Colorado Volunteers.
Indeed, as we are told in the novel, Spotted
Wolf had been instrumental in George Crook's
humiliating defeat at Rosebud Creek, Montana,
in 1876, and he had been at Little Big
Horn too in that same year. Near the beginning
of the film we learn that Private Gant's own
father had been killed at the Little Big Horn the
previous year, yet by the end of the film it is,
inexplicably, November 29, 1864, when we relive
the gory and ultraviolent (though poorly
re-created) Sand Creek Massacre. Colonel
Iverson becomes Lieutenant Calley, and Soldier
Blue becomes an uneasy parallel to My Lai
during which U.S. soldiers wantonly rape,
murder, and mutilate hundreds of Native
American men, women, and children.</p>
