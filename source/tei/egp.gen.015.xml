<head type="main">GENDER AND SENSE OF PLACE</head>

<p>Women and men experience the Great Plains
in very different ways. The characteristics they
find appealing or repellent, the reasons they
have for being there, even the terms they use
to describe Plains life and landscape are distinctly
different, almost as if they were describing
different worlds. Women often praise
the interpersonal qualities of small-town life
in the region, such as the closeness of families,
the closer intergenerational ties, and the intimacy
and helpfulness of the community. In
contrast, men typically laud the Plains as an
ideal context for work and play, citing independence,
opportunity, and freedom to work
their own schedules. Women understand the
merits men see in Plains life. They describe
the flexibility and freedom men enjoy in their
work, and how the "frontier" qualities of the
Plains appeal to men, but they usually consider
these the exclusive domain of males. In
fact, many women regard the Plains as primarily
a man's place, and they feel more restricted
to traditional female roles in work,
home life, and community than they would in
other places. Plains society does not readily
acknowledge it when women share in traditional
men's work. For instance, many women
work full-time on the family farm but rarely
are recognized as farmers.</p>

<p>Men are much more likely than women to
find the Plains physically appealing. They
get an expansive feeling from the open landscape
and regard the remoteness and emptiness
of the Plains as a source of welcome solitude,
privacy, and freedom from disturbance.
Women, in contrast, frequently deride the
emptiness and treelessness, report feeling
"vulnerable" or "exposed" in the open, and
describe the landscape with foreboding terms
such as "barren," "desolate," "edge of the
earth," or "vast nothingness." They often experience
what men affectionately call "solitude"
as social isolation, cultural deprivation, and
domestic inconvenience.</p>

<p>Distinctions are even more pronounced between
men and women who immigrate from
outside the Plains. Immigrant men adapt
readily to Plains life and typically embrace an
exhilarating sense of widened horizons and
expanded possibilities. Immigrant women are
much more likely to complain of restrictive
gender roles, oppressive social norms, social
and emotional isolation, and a lack of professional
or recreational opportunities. Even after
decades of residence, they can suffer from
culture and landscape shock, and they often
admit to pining for their original homes and
richer landscapes.</p>

<p>These responses are especially intriguing in
light of the nearly identical gender distinctions
that appear in accounts of early European
American settlers, especially regarding
the landscape. The forces that drew men
to, and repelled women from, the Plains in the
nineteenth century apparently still operate today.
This could be a culturally imprinted contrast
in sensitivity or aesthetics, but its endurance
suggests that a gender distinction
may exist that is deeper than the cultural milieu.
Perhaps, as some research suggests, men
have an innate preference for open landscapes,
and women for shelter. This question
may never be answered, but its emergence in
the Great Plains offers insight into the relationship
between gender and sense of place.</p>
