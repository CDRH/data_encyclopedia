<p>The only woman on Lewis and Clark's expedition,
Sacagawea was a young Shoshone who
had been captured by Hidatsa raiders near the
three forks of the Missouri River about 1800.
She married trader Toussaint Charbonneau
sometime before 1804. A son, Jean Baptiste,
called "Pomp" by Clark, was born to them in
February of 1805. Together, the family traveled
from the Mandan-Hidatsa villages in presentday
North Dakota to the Pacific and back.</p>

<p>Sacagawea has been the object of considerable
myth and misinformation; her contributions
to the expedition have been both exaggerated
and minimized. Clark thought more of
her contributions than did Lewis, though one
must consider here the eighteenth-century
tendency to discount contributions of nonwhite
peoples. In a letter to Charbonneau after
the expedition, Clark wrote, "Your woman diserved
a greater reward for her attention and
services on that rout than we had in our power
to give her." Lewis's view was more dismissive:
"If she has enough to eat and a few trinkets
I believe she would be perfectly content anywhere."</p>

<p>In fact, Sacagawea's contributions were real:
she provided important geographical data to
the party at various times, she helped as translator
with certain tribes, she rescued important
documents during a canoe mishap in May
1805, and, perhaps most important, she gave a
friendlier face to the Corps of Discovery. Clark
wrote that she "reconsiles all the Indians, as to
our friendly intentions, a woman with a party
of men is a token of peace."</p>

<p>Sacagawea died of a "putrid fever" in
December 1812 near present-day Mobridge,
South Dakota, at about age thirty-two. Jean
Baptiste and Sacagawea's daughter, Lizette,
lived with Clark at St. Louis for a time.</p>
