<p><persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Cuthbert Grant</persName> is best known as the captain of the <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Plains</geogName> <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> who clashed with the Selkirk settlers at the Seven Oaks Massacre (near present <placeName rend="settlement" key="mb.win" reg="Winnipeg, Manitoba">Winnipeg, Manitoba</placeName>) on June 19, 1816. The <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> victory nearly destroyed the fledgling <placeName rend="colony" key="col.rrc" reg="Red River Colony">Red River Colony</placeName>, which later became the province of <placeName rend="state" key="mb" reg="Manitoba">Manitoba</placeName>, and enshrined <persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Grant</persName> as the founder of the <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> nation. This sense of <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> nationhood would play a role in the Red River Resistance of 1869–70 and the North-West Rebellion of 1885.</p>

<p><persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Cuthbert Grant</persName> was born in 1793 at <placeName rend="fort" key="fort.sk.rt" reg="Fort de la Rivière Tremblante">Fort de la Rivi&#233;re Tremblante</placeName> (<placeName rend="state" key="sk" reg="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</placeName>) to <persName reg="Grant, Sr., Cuthbert">Cuthbert Grant Sr.</persName>, a <orgName rend="business" key="bus.nwc" reg="North West Company">North West Company</orgName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">NWC</hi>) trader, and a <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> woman of French Cree ancestry. He was sent to <placeName rend="settlement" key="qc.mon" reg="Montreal, Quebec">Montreal</placeName> to be educated. In 1810 he joined the <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName rend="business" key="bus.nwc" reg="North West Company">NWC</placeName></hi>, returning to the Northwest in 1812 at a time when the <orgName rend="business" key="bus.hbc" reg="Hudson's Bay Company">Hudson's Bay Company</orgName> (<hi rend="smallcaps"><orgName rend="business" key="bus.hbc" reg="Hudson's Bay Company">HBC</orgName></hi>) and the <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName rend="business" key="bus.nwc" reg="North West Company">NWC</placeName></hi> were engaged in a fierce competition for furtrade supremacy in <geogName rend="region" reg="British North America">British North America</geogName>. The <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName rend="business" key="bus.nwc" reg="North West Company">NWC</placeName></hi> tried to use the <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> in their struggles against the hbc by instilling in them the idea that they were a nation with rights to the territory. The <hi rend="smallcaps"><orgName rend="business" key="bus.nwc" reg="North West Company">NWC</orgName></hi> also appointed <persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Grant</persName> as "Captain-General of all the Half-Breeds" with the intention that he and his <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> kinsmen would destroy the <placeName rend="colony" key="col.rrc" reg="Red River Colony">Red River Colony</placeName>, which was backed by the <hi rend="smallcaps"><orgName rend="business" key="bus.hbc" reg="Hudson's Bay Company">HBC</orgName></hi>. The M&#233;tis, for their part, needed little encouragement after the colony's governor prohibited the export of pemmican from the district and forbade the hunting of buffalo near the settlement.</p>

<p>The Seven Oaks Massacre began when the colony's governor attempted to stop <persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Grant</persName> and his men from carting pemmican out of the country. In this battle <persName reg="Semple, Robert">Governor Robert Semple</persName> and twenty-one of his men were killed but only one of the M&#233;tis. This violence, which contributed to the eventual merger of the two fur-trading companies in 1821, vastly increased <persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Grant</persName>'s prestige among the M&#233;tis. For this reason the new <hi rend="smallcaps"><orgName rend="business" key="bus.hbc" reg="Hudson's Bay Company">HBC</orgName></hi> tried to use <persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Grant</persName> as a means of controlling the <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> and winning them over to the settlement. In 1824 they offered <persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Grant</persName> a large land grant at <geogName rend="region" reg="White Horse Plains">White Horse Plains</geogName> (part of the <placeName rend="colony" key="col.rrc" reg="Red River Colony">Red River Colony</placeName>) with the hope that he would settle the <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> there and prevent them from trading with the Americans. In 1828 the company also appointed <persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Grant</persName> as "Warden of the Plains," paid him a large salary, and allowed him to trade in furs if he would prevent his kinsmen from doing the same.</p>

<p><persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Grant</persName> remained a respected leader and chief of the <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> buffalo hunt until the 1840s, when a younger generation of <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.met" reg="M&#233;tis">M&#233;tis</orgName> openly defied his authority to trade furs illegally to the Americans on the upper <geogName rend="river" reg="Missouri River">Missouri</geogName>. No longer effective, <persName reg="Grant, Cuthbert">Grant</persName> was let go by the hbc, and the rest of his life was fairly uneventful. He died on July 15, 1854, after falling from his horse.</p>
