<p>William Coffin Coleman founded a manufacturing
company that became a world leader in
the production of camping equipment. Born
in Chatham, New York, on May 21, 1870, Coleman
grew up in Labette County, Kansas. To
earn money as a law student at the University
of Kansas in 1900, he began selling a lamp that
burned gasoline under high pressure. Sales
were disappointing, so he acquired the lamp's
patent and redesigned it. Soon he was manufacturing
his own version in a small building
in Wichita, Kansas.</p>

<p>In 1905 Coleman's arc lanterns lit one of the
first night football games ever played&#8211;at
Wichita's Fairmount College, later Wichita
State University. Coleman's lanterns quickly
became popular with farmers, campers, and
emergency workers. Through the years, he
added more products, including heaters and
air conditioners. During World War II, American
servicemen in Europe and Asia used
more than one million of Coleman's ingenious
"<hi rend="smallcaps">GI</hi> pocket stoves," ranked with the jeep
as the one of the most important pieces of
noncombat equipment developed during the
war.</p>

<p>After William's death in Wichita on November
2, 1957, his son and grandson, Sheldon
and Sheldon C. Coleman, managed the Wichita
company. By the 1960s their expansion
into the camping and recreation products
market had made Coleman a household word.
In a 1989 hostile takeover, New York investor
Ron Perelman acquired the Kansas firm. The
Sunbeam Corporation took control in 1998,
moving the headquarters from Wichita to
Boca Raton, Florida. At that time, Coleman
had manufacturing plants in eight states and
six foreign countries. The bulk of its employees
were in Wichita, making William
Coleman's former company one of Kansas's
leading exporters.</p>
