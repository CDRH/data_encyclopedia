<head type="main">HALLMARK CARDS, INC.</head>

<p>Joyce C. Hall, born in David City, Nebraska,
founded Hallmark Cards, Inc. in 1910. His
brother Rollie joined him in 1911, and the two
brothers opened up a specialty store in downtown
Kansas City, Missouri. The original
company was called Hall Brothers, Inc., and
the men were jobbers of greeting cards, buying
designs created and manufactured elsewhere
and then selling them wholesale to
drugstores, bookstores, and gift shops.</p>

<p>In 1915 the Hall Brothers changed the scope
of their operations after a devastating fire that
destroyed the storefront and all of their inventory.
The brothers purchased an engraving
firm and began creating the first original Hallmark
designs. William Hall, who had stayed
behind to run a bookstore in the family's
hometown of Norfolk, Nebraska, joined Joyce
and Rollie in 1921. The company changed its
name in 1954 to Hallmark Cards, Inc.</p>

<p>Still privately owned, the company reported
consolidated net sales in excess of $3.9
billion in 1998. Hallmark publishes its products
in more than thirty languages and distributes
them in more than 100 countries. Domestically,
the company has approximately
47,000 domestic retail outlets. Hallmark employs
almost 21,000 people worldwide, with
about 10,000 of them in the Great Plains. The
creative staff consists of more than 700 people
who produce 30,000 new or redesigned greeting
cards and related products annually. In
addition to greeting cards, the firm sells holiday
ornaments, writing paper, jigsaw puzzles,
photo albums, calendars, gift wrap, ribbons,
home decor specialty products, party goods,
and a variety of other gift items.</p>

<p>Hallmark operates manufacturing plants in
Kansas City, Missouri, and Lawrence, Topeka,
and Leavenworth, Kansas. Distribution plants
are located in Liberty, Missouri, and Enfield,
Connecticut. In addition, two of the company's
major subsidiaries have operations in
the Great Plains. These include Binney &amp;
Smith, headquartered in Easton, Pennsylvania,
the maker of Crayola, Liquitex, and Silly
Putty, and Crown Center, an eighty-five-acre
commercial and residential complex adjacent
to the Hallmark headquarters in Kansas City.
The Crown Center complex attracts more
than five million people annually.</p>
