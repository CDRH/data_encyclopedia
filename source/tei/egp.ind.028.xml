<p>Homestake Mining Company began operations
in the Black Hills of Dakota Territory
(now South Dakota) in 1877 after a group of
California miners purchased the Golden Star
and Homestake claims for $70,000. These
original claims comprised approximately ten
acres. By 1999 the Homestake Mine had grown
to more than 8,000 acres of patented claims
and was the oldest continually operating gold
mine in the world.</p>

<p>Located in Lead, South Dakota, Homestake
Mine consisted of an "open cut" surface operation
as well as an 8,000-foot-deep underground
mine. Over the years, the Homestake
Mine produced more than 39 million ounces
of gold, and there were an additional 4.7 million
ounces of proven and probable reserves as
of 1997. In 1998 the Homestake Mine experienced
major restructuring with the implementation
of a new operating plan that was
designed to lower production costs in the underground
mine from $355 per ounce to $280
per ounce. The company also spent nearly
$100 million to reclaim portions of the Whitewood
Creek Superfund Site that served as a
tailings and municipal waste dump for nearly
100 years.</p>

<p>Homestake Mining Company entered the
New York Stock Exchange in 1977. The company
had focused solely on gold mining until
the 1950s and 1960s, when it delved into uranium,
lead, and zinc mining. The company
became even more diversified in the early
1980s, when it purchased fossil fuel developments.
Homestake also aggressively acquired
additional gold mines in Australia and Canada
at this time. In early 2001 Homestake
ranked as the second largest gold producer in
the United States.</p>

<p>The Homestake Mine itself, however, has
experienced an interesting turn of events. Despite
the new operating plan, falling gold prices
and depleted reserves led to cutbacks and ultimately
closure of the mine. The Homestake
Mining Company removed its last gold ore on
December 14, 2001, merged with Barrick Gold
of Toronto, ceased mining operations completely
on December 31, 2001, then donated the
mine for use as an astrophysics laboratory. A
small laboratory run by the University of
Pennsylvania for nearly twenty years deep in
the underground mine served as the nucleus
for this newer, larger National Underground
Science Laboratory. Work at this new lab
would focus on the study of subatomic particles
emitted from the sun, called neutrinos, at a
depth of 7,400 feet beneath the surface. At this
depth, interference from background cosmic
radiation is filtered out, allowing only neutrinos
to pass through. The laboratory received
interim funding in the fall of 2001, and a proposal
for the five-year, 281-million-dollar facility
was submitted to the National Science
Foundation in 2001. The final funding decision
is still pending. The National Underground
Science Laboratory would hire a number of
former Homestake employees and bring in astrophysicists
from all over the world, continuing
the long and storied legacy of the Homestake
Mine. As of April 2003, Barrick Gold had
agreed in principle to donate the mine for use
as a laboratory, but only if Barrick stockholders
were protected from environmental liability
for the property.</p>
