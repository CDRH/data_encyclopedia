<p>Kool-Aid, the powdered drink mix known to
generations of children, was invented by Edwin
E. Perkins in Hastings, Nebraska, in 1927.
Perkins was born in Lewis, Iowa, in 1889 but
spent his youth in the village of Hendley in
southwestern Nebraska. While working in his
father's general store, Perkins became fascinated
with kitchen chemistry experiments,
prepackaged foods like Jell-O, and mail-order
sales schemes. After World War I, the budding
entrepreneur invented a tobacco remedy
called Nix-O-Tine, the first of his many patent
medicines.</p>

<p>In 1920 Perkins and his new wife, Kathryn
"Kitty" Shoemaker, moved to Hastings and
expanded the Perkins Products Company,
which sold more than 125 household products
through direct sales. One of the most popular
was Fruit-Smack, a liquid fruit drink concentrate.
In 1927 Perkins reconstituted Fruit-
Smack into powdered crystals and packaged it
in bright paper envelopes. Originally called
Kool-Ade, the drink mix was sold in selfservice
display cartons (another Perkins innovation)
in grocery stores and was so successful
that the company moved to Chicago in 1931.
By the end of the Great Depression, Edwin
Perkins owned a suburban mansion and employed
hundreds of workers in his factory. In
1953 Perkins retired and sold the company to
General Foods, the manufacturer of Jell-O.</p>

<p>Edwin and Kitty Perkins spent their remaining
years establishing foundations and
making gifts to colleges, hospitals, and other
institutions in Nebraska and elsewhere. When
he died in 1961, Kool-Aid's inventor, who had
lived in a sod house as a child, left an estate
worth over $45 million and a product that had
become a household name.</p>
