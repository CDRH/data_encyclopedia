<head type="main">PACKARD, DAVID (1912-1996)</head>

<p>David Packard, along with his partner, William
Hewlett, established the computer industry
giant Hewlett-Packard. Packard was born
on September 7, 1912, in Pueblo, Colorado. He
attended Stanford University, where he earned
varsity letters in football and basketball and
graduated in 1934. After several months of
graduate work at the University of Colorado,
Packard took a job with General Electric in
Schenectady, New York, in 1938. That year
he married Lucile Salter of San Francisco,
whom he had met at Stanford. He returned to
Stanford and completed a master's degree in
electrical engineering. In 1939 he and fellow
graduate student William Hewlett founded
Hewlett-Packard with a capital investment of
$538. The company's first product was an electrical
oscillator, a device for testing audio
equipment. Early orders came from the Walt
Disney studios.</p>

<p>In 1947 the two inventors incorporated
their business, with Packard named as president.
Packard served as president until 1964,
when he became chairman of the board and
chief executive officer. He remained in this
position from 1964 until 1969, then took leave
to become deputy secretary of defense in the
Nixon administration. He served there until
1971. In 1972 he was reelected as chairman of
Hewlett-Packard, a position he held until his
retirement in 1993. He remained active in the
business until his death.</p>

<p>In addition to its products, which include
measurement and computational devices used
in industry, business, engineering, science,
medicine, and education, Hewlett-Packard is
known for its innovative management style,
known as the "<hi rend="smallcaps">HP</hi> way," which is designed to
maintain high productivity and employee loyalty.
The <hi rend="smallcaps">HP</hi> way includes catastrophic medical
coverage, flexible work hours, open offices, decentralized
decision making, management by
objective, employee profit sharing, and discount
stock purchases.</p>

<p>Packard was active in business, government,
and philanthropy. He was a trustee of Stanford
University from 1954 to 1969, a member of the
Trilateral Commission from 1973 to 1981, and a
member of the White House Science Council
and the National Academy of Engineering. He
cofounded the American Electronics Association.
From 1975 to 1983 he sat on the U.S.-USSR
Trade and Economic Council's committee on
science and technology, and he was director of
the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation
from 1985 until 1987. He also served on the
President's Council of Advisors on Science and
Technology from 1990 until 1992. Through the
David and Lucile Packard Foundation, which
was established in 1964, he and his wife donated
more than $400 million to various
charities, community organizations, education,
health care, conservation, science, and
the arts. In addition to the work of the foundation,
Packard personally donated hundreds of
millions more, including $300 million to Stanford
University. David Packard, a pioneer in
the computer industry, died on March 26,
1996, at Stanford University Hospital.</p>
