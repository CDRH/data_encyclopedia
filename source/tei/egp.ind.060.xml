<head type="main">WEATHER INDUSTRY</head>

<p>As the nicknames "Tornado Alley," "Dust
Bowl," and "blizzard country" imply, weather
has a major impact in the Great Plains. The
variety and intensity of Plains weather justify
its description as a "climate of extremes." For
these reasons, the region is home to a sizable
percentage of the country's weather and climate
research institutions, government service
agencies, and weather information businesses.
Among what is nationally a relatively small
sector of specialized business, the "weather industry"
in the Plains has a substantial impact,
especially in certain local areas. The potential
impact of severe weather on such weathersensitive
industries as aviation, highway and
rail transportation, insurance businesses, and
agriculture creates a high demand for weather
data, weather-monitoring equipment, and
weather professionals. Private weather enterprises
include weather data and hardware
vendors, wind energy generation, aviation and
agricultural weather forecast services, and
even weather modification companies that
provide cloud seeding for hail suppression
or precipitation enhancement. Television
weather coverage in the Plains, with an emphasis
on tornado warning dissemination, is
extensive and highly detailed, with stations in
Oklahoma City, Tulsa, and Wichita devoting
more resources to weather coverage than their
counterparts in large markets such as Los Angeles,
New York, and Chicago.</p>

<p>Significant concentrations of private businesses
devoted to weather and climate data
analysis and forecasting are found in the Dallas–
Fort Worth, Oklahoma City, and Wichita
metropolitan areas. Major centers for public
weather research include Boulder, Colorado,
Lubbock, Texas, Rapid City, South Dakota,
and, most notably, Norman, Oklahoma. Numerous
agencies of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (<hi rend="smallcaps">NOAA</hi>), a division
of the U.S. Department of Commerce, are
headquartered in the Plains. The Aviation
Weather Center, responsible for worldwide
weather forecasting for American civilian airlines,
is located in Kansas City, and its military
equivalent is in Omaha.</p>

<p>The emergence of Norman as the world's
primary center for research, monitoring, and
prediction of tornadoes and severe local
storms began in 1948 at nearby Tinker Air
Force Base, where tornado forecasting was pioneered.
The evolution continued in 1964 with
the establishment in Norman of the National
Severe Storms Laboratory (<hi rend="smallcaps">NSSL</hi>), where Doppler
weather radar was developed and tested.
In 1997, under modernization initiatives of the
National Weather Service (<hi rend="smallcaps">NWS</hi>), the Storm
Prediction Center, responsible for the issuance
of severe weather watches and hazardous
weather guidance nationwide, relocated to
Norman from Kansas City. Additional <hi rend="smallcaps">NOAA</hi>
agencies, including an <hi rend="smallcaps">NWS</hi> office, the <hi rend="smallcaps">NEXRAD</hi>
(National Weather Service's Next Generation
Weather Radar) Radar Operational Support
Facility, and numerous federal and state atmospheric
research institutes associated with
nssl and the University of Oklahoma, were
placed under one cooperative umbrella in 1998
as the Oklahoma Weather Center. The center,
with emphasis in the development of numerical
forecast models, environmental monitoring
systems, tornado research, and severe
weather forecasting, directly employs 600 people
and injects more than $60 million annually
into the economy.</p>
