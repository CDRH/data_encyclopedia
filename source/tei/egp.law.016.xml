<p>In 1883 the U.S. Supreme Court rendered a decision
in <hi rend="italic">Ex Parte Crow Dog</hi> that reaffirmed a
basic promise of federal law as it dealt with
the Native American nations: that these nations
are political sovereigns and have a right
to be ruled by their own law in their own land.
Within three years the same Court would
break that promise, just as the political
branches of the government had broken treaties.
Nevertheless, <hi rend="italic">Ex Parte Crow Dog</hi> remains a
foundational case for the tradition of legal pluralism
that is today manifested in the laws and
institutions of Native American sovereigns.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of August 5, 1881, Kangi
Sunka (Crow Dog) shot and killed Sinte
Gleska (Spotted Tail) on a road in the Rosebud
Indian Agency on the Great Sioux Reservation
in Dakota Territory. Both men were
respected among the Brule Lakota. At the time
of his death Spotted Tail was attempting to
maintain a homeland for his people as both a
traditional chief and a leader recognized by
the Bureau of Indian Affairs (<hi rend="smallcaps">BIA</hi>). Crow Dog
had ridden with Crazy Horse yet also served
several terms as a <hi rend="smallcaps">BIA</hi>-appointed chief of Brule
police. The complex forces of culture and politics
that pitted these two men as enemies remain
a mystery. The facts of their encounter
are still disputed: was it assassination or self defense?</p>

<p>After the death of Spotted Tail the tribal
council met and, following Brul√© law, sent
peacemakers to both families to restore harmony
and order. The families agreed to a payment
of $600 and gifts of eight horses and
one blanket, which were quickly delivered to
Spotted Tail's people. Nevertheless, in contravention
of prior policy that had honored Native
American self-government, Henry Lelar,
the acting agent at Rosebud, ordered the arrest
of Crow Dog. He was quickly arrested and
imprisoned at Fort Niobrara, Nebraska.</p>

<p>Crow Dog's trial in federal court, Dakota
Territory, was tainted by strong anti-Indian
prejudice. The lead prosecution witness, Agent
John Cook, was in Chicago when the killing
occurred, but he testified to Crow Dog's political
animosity. Crow Dog, ably represented by
attorney A. J. Plowman, was allowed to present
his claim of self-defense, but Pretty Camp, his
wife and an eyewitness, was not allowed to
testify. Moreover, there is unsettling evidence
of perjury. But all of this factual controversy is
beside the point. The claim of federal jurisdiction,
the legal power to make and apply law
for Indian-to-Indian matters within Indian
Country, is the crux of the matter, and the
conviction and death sentence given Crow
Dog brought the issue to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>By writ of habeas corpus Crow Dog urged
the Supreme Court to deny federal jurisdiction
in the matter. At the same time, the <hi rend="smallcaps">BIA</hi>
and the prosecution, which had orchestrated
the arrest and trial as part of a plan conceived
as early as 1874 to extend federal law into Indian
Country, argued that treaties and statutes
provided federal jurisdiction. The federal government
made the following argument: section
5339 of the <hi rend="italic">Revised Statutes</hi> provides for
the death penalty for any murder within the
jurisdiction of the United States; title 28 extends
the general law of the United States to
Indian Country, but it has an exception for
crimes committed by one Indian against another
Indian; that exception was repealed by
the treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), which provided
that "bad men among the Indians" shall
be delivered to the United States; and the
act of 1877 (Congress had prohibited further
treaty making with Native Americans in 1871)
provides that Congress shall "secure to [the
Sioux Nations] an orderly government; [and]
they shall be subject to the laws of the United
States."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court rejected the government's
argument, stating that such an understanding
would reverse an unbroken policy of
respect for Native American sovereignty. First,
if "bad men" were not delivered, the treaty
called for deductions from annuities due the
Lakotas; thus it could not mean "bad men"
who acted against other Sioux. Second, the
statutory promise of "orderly government"
meant a pledge of self-government for the
Sioux. Finally, to be "subject to the laws of the
United States" meant subject to the power of
Congress to make federal Indian law for distribution
of sovereignty between Native Americans
and the United States, not subject as individuals
to the generality of federal law. Crow
Dog was granted his release.</p>

<p>Crow Dog returned to the Rosebud Agency.
He remained a leader among the Brul&#233;, taking
Ghost Dancers into the Badlands in 1890 and
refusing an allotment until 1910. The <hi rend="smallcaps">BIA</hi> repeatedly
sought his removal from the Rosebud
Agency. He died there in 1912.</p>

<p>Yet <hi rend="italic">Ex Parte Crow Dog</hi> was tainted by racism.
Its concluding language referred to Native
Americans living a "savage life" and having
a "savage nature," and it described Native
American law as the "red man's revenge." This
played into the hands of the Interior Department
and the <hi rend="smallcaps">BIA</hi>, which had since the late
1870s urged Congress to pass a statute extending
federal law to Indian-on-Indian crimes
within Indian Country. Two years after <hi rend="italic">Ex
Parte Crow Dog</hi> Congress passed the Major
Crimes Act of 1885. The act cut deeply into the
promises of self-government and sovereignty
by creating federal jurisdiction over seven
enumerated crimes when committed by one
Indian against another Indian. (Today the
statute covers fourteen crimes.)</p>

<p>A year later, in <hi rend="italic">United States v. Kagama</hi>
(1886), the Supreme Court upheld the legality
of the act. The Court found a "duty of protection"
arising from the "weakness and helplessness"
of the Native Americans that granted
Congress power despite the lack of any constitutional
authority. Civilization was brought to
Indian Country in the form of punishment,
retribution, violence, and isolation of wrongdoers.
The plenary power of Congress over
Native American affairs was affirmed, and the
people witnessed again the fragile nature of
legal promises.</p>
