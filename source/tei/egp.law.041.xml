<head type="main">PIERRE-GUILLAUME SAYER TRIAL</head>

<p>The trial of Pierre-Guillaume Sayer on May 17,
1849, marked the effective end of the Hudson's
Bay Company's trade monopoly in western
Canada. Sayer was a Metis who, together with
three companions, had traded liquor for furs
in defiance of the company's trade monopoly.
Most of the Metis were descendants of traders
of the North West Company, which had been
amalgamated with the Hudson's Bay Company
in 1821. The North West Company and
its traders had never recognized the legality of
the Hudson's Bay Company's monopoly, but
after the amalgamation the company was able,
for a time, to enforce its monopoly by military
means. Most of the Metis chafed under the
company's restrictive policies, and their leaders,
including Louis Riel Sr. (father of the
Metis leader in the 1869-70 and 1885 troubles),
appealed to a growing sense of Metis
identity and nationalism. They argued that by
right of exploration and trade conducted by
their fathers and through Native rights derived
from their mothers, the Metis should
not be subject to the Hudson's Bay Company's
restrictive trade policies.</p>

<p>The company's position was weakened in
1848 when the small contingent of British regular
troops was withdrawn from Red River.
Company officials, who were also the law officers
of the colony, nevertheless decided to
bring Sayer and his companions to trial. The
case was brought before the General Quarterly
Court of Assiniboia, but on the day of the
trial several hundred well-armed Metis buffalo
hunters threatened violence if Sayer and
his companions were sent to prison. A jury
acceptable to both sides was impaneled and
in due course found Sayer guilty but recommended
mercy. That recommendation was almost
certainly a result of intimidation, since
neither the court nor the company had the
means to control and subdue the well-armed
and angry Metis. Officially, mercy was recommended
on the grounds that Sayer believed
what he had done was legal.</p>

<p>The Hudson's Bay Company's chief factor at
Red River accepted the jury's recommendation.
Sayer was allowed to go free, and the
charges against his companions were dropped.
The Metis, regarding the outcome a a great
victory, discharged their guns in delight,
shouting "La commerce est libre!" Thereafter,
the company undertook no further legal action
at Red River to enforce its trade monopoly,
relying instead on competitive practices to
protect its trade. In practice, the Sayer trial
ended the Hudson's Bay Company's trade monopoly.
Legally, it only expired twenty years
later with the transfer of the territory to the
Canadian government.</p>
