<head type="main">DUST BOWL LITERATURE</head>

<p>During the 1930s a number of literary texts
illustrated drought, dusters, and economic
depression through powerful stories and contributed
to aesthetic movements for social realism
and cultural regionalism.</p>

<p>John Steinbeck's 1939 novel, <title level="m">The Grapes of Wrath</title>, inspired the nation with its tale of
a tenant-farm family, the Joads, who lost
their home in eastern Oklahoma and searched
for a more promising land in California. The
novel accentuated human dignity and courage
against a mechanistic, exploitative social system.
In 1937 Frederick Manfred wrote the first
draft of his novel <title level="m">The Golden Bowl</title>, which
was published in 1944. He portrayed a spirited
resistance to fate in the Northern Plains by
focusing on Maury Grant, a wandering protagonist
who returned to the Dust Bowl and
started the cycle of conquest again. After embracing
his fate, he and the Thors, a mythic
family holding onto a dying land, refused to
abandon their homestead.</p>

<p>Set within Kansas during the late nineteenth
century, John Ise's <title level="m">Sod and Stubble: The Story of a Kansas Homestead</title> (1936) recounts a
familial story of remarkable heroism against
drought, grasshoppers, fires, dust storms, and
economic depression. Women homesteaders
in the Dakotas are featured in Edith Kohl's
mixed autobiography and novel, <title level="m">The Land of the Burnt Thigh</title> (1938).</p>

<p>Lawrence Svobida, a western Kansas farmer
turned author, recounted a cautionary tale in
his 1940 autobiography, <title level="m">An Empire of Dust</title>.
Though his wheat farm failed to survive the
dust storms and adverse climate, Svobida
worked incessantly to win a harvest and to
keep the land from blowing away. The story
underscores frustration and pride, but it ends
in failure.</p>

<p>Paul Sears, a botanist at the University of
Oklahoma, authored the most significant ecological
text of the decade. Alarmed by the violent
dust storms raging across the continent,
in <title level="m">Deserts on the March</title> (1935) he explained
how the rapid conquest of North America had
upset the balance of nature. If the nation was
headed down such a slippery slope, Sears argued,
then the assumptions of frontier progress
required reexamination.</p>

<p>Kenneth Porter's prose and poetry, which
lament the failures embodied in a dust cloud
over Kansas, appeared in a number of magazines
in the 1930s. After the Dust Bowl conditions
faded from the landscape, Lois Phillips
Hudson's <title level="m">The Bones of Plenty</title> (1962) and <title level="m">Reapers of the Dust</title> (1964) reinvented empty land,
solid inhabitants, and frontier myths for subsequent
generations. Ann Marie Low's <title level="m">Dust Bowl Diary</title> (1984) recalls the difficulties of
farm life in North Dakota.</p>

<p>Dust bowl literature thus illuminates the
human fight against extreme temperatures,
soil erosion, agricultural maladjustment, and
swirling winds. While the crisis exposed the
nation to a range of anxieties, literature was a
vehicle that could bring the Dust Bowl into
the experiences of readers outside the region.
Limning a powerful landscape in national
memory, Dust Bowl literature invented an enduring
iconography for the Great Plains.</p>
