<p>Charles William Gordon was Canada's first
best-selling novelist. Born on September 13,
1860, in Glengarry County, Ontario, to Mary
Robertson Gordon and Scots missionary Daniel
Gordon, Charles was educated at universities
in Toronto and Edinburgh, earning a
doctor of divinity. He served as a Methodist
missionary in pioneer settlements west of Calgary
from 1890 to 1893, then as pastor of St.
Stephen's Church in Winnipeg until his death
on October 31, 1937.</p>

<p>Gordon began writing moral tales under
the pseudonym "Ralph Connor" to promote
missionary work, but because he happened to
be a gifted storyteller, his first three books,
<title level="m">Black Rock</title> (1898), <title level="m">The Sky Pilot</title> (1899), and
<title level="m">The Man from Glengarry</title> (1901), sold over five
million copies&#8211;an unheard-of number for a
Canadian author. He wrote twenty more, and
for a time his popularity could be compared
to Zane Grey's. Gordon counted national
leaders such as Wilfrid Laurier, Theodore
Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson among his
readers and friends and was himself one of
Canada's most prominent citizens, providing
leadership in national and international
organizations.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the Reverend Gordon's
romances were didactic, promoting the values
of muscular Christianity, the Social Gospel,
and the Empire. Their patriarchal, imperialist,
and ethnocentric assumptions render them
worse than irrelevant today, but Gordon did
embrace the more liberal social and political
ideas of his time, including public ownership
of certain industries.</p>

<p>Only a few of Gordon's romances are set on
the Plains or in the foothills, including <title level="m">The Foreigner</title> (1909) and <title level="m">Corporal Cameron of the North West Mounted Police</title> (1912). <title level="m">The Sky Pilot</title>
epitomizes these Western stories, depicting
a young tenderfoot missionary winning over
the blasphemous ranch hands by proving he is
straight and manly. In Gordon's marriage of
East and West, counter to the American frontier
formula, western vitality is tamed by eastern
refinement.</p>
