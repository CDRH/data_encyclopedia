<p>From the very first incursion of European
Americans into the Great Plains (the Spaniard
Cabeza de Vaca, about 1534), the memoir has
been a preeminent form for the region's writers.
Confronted with an unfamiliar and treeless
landscape peopled by culturally alien Natives
and roamed over by buffalo (an animal he
was the first recorded European to have seen),
Cabeza de Vaca recalled his experiences and
then wrote and published his <title level="m">Relaci&#243;n</title> (1542).
It began an autobiographical memoir tradition
that continues today through volumes
such as Ian Frazier's <title level="m">Great Plains</title> (1989), William
Least Heat-Moon's <title level="m">PrairyErth</title> (1991), and
Sharon Butala's <title level="m">The Perfection of the Morning</title>
(1994). So pervasive is the form that two of the
region's best-known novels&#8211;Willa Cather's
<title level="m">My &#193;ntonia</title> (1918) and Sinclair Ross's <title level="m">As for Me and My House</title> (1941)&#8211;adopt the illusion of
memoir for fictional purposes. This was nothing
new: when James Fenimore Cooper first
used the Great Plains as the fictional setting in
his <title level="m">The Prairie</title> (1823), his primary source for
landscape description was Edwin James's
memoir of Major Stephen Long's 1819-20 expedition
to the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Cabeza de Vaca's account was followed by
Pedro de Casta&#241;eda's <title level="m">Narrative</title> (1896) of the
Coronado expedition of 1540–42, and, as the
Great Plains was visited by other explorers
through the early nineteenth century, numerous
other accounts were written and published.
On the Canadian Plains the British furtrading
companies sponsored the explorations
&#8211;and ultimately the writing&#8211;of early figures
such as Henry Kelsey (c. 1667–1724), Anthony
Henday (who journeyed through the Plains in
the mid-1700s), and David Thompson (1770–
1857); of these, Thompson's <title level="m">Narrative</title> is the
best known and most detailed.</p>

<p>As the United States expanded onto the
Great Plains before the Civil War, several aesthetically
shaped memoirs appeared: Washington
Irving's account of his trip to the Indian
Territory, <title level="m">A Tour on the Prairies</title> (1835),
was but one of three western books published
by America's then most acknowledged man of
letters. This period also saw Josiah Gregg's
Commerce of the <title level="m">Prairies</title> (1844) and painter
George Catlin's <title level="m">Letters and Notes</title> (1841). (Catlin's
Canadian counterpart, Paul Kane, published
<title level="m">Wanderings of an Artist</title> in 1859.) The
single most significant memoir of the prewar
period, however, is Francis Parkman's <title level="m">The Oregon Trail</title> (1849). The young historian was
determined, during his overland trip to the
Rockies in the summer of 1846, to see and
describe Native Americans, their landscapes,
and their ways of life.</p>

<p>After the war, as exploration gave way to
settlement, pioneering memoirs&#8211;both unpublished
and published&#8211;supplanted travelers'
accounts. Of these, Hamlin Garland's
various autobiographical memoirs&#8211;especially
<title level="m">A Son of the Middle Border</title> (1917) and <title level="m">A Daughter of the Middle Border</title> (1921)&#8211;are representative
and may be read within the contexts
of Garland's fiction. Like such fiction&#8211;
and that by Cather, Wallace Stegner, Wright
Morris, Robert Kroetsch, and others&#8211;the
Great Plains memoir since settlement has focused
on understanding the region&#8211;in Morris's
phrase&#8211;as "home place." Of these, three
autobiographical memoirs stand out particularly.
Frederick Philip Grove's <title level="m">Over Prairie Trails</title> (1922) recounts the author's weekly
struggle traveling through the Manitoba bush
to reach his family, who lived some distance
away. The other two, Mari Sandoz's <title level="m">Love Song to the Plains</title> (1961) and Wallace Stegner's <title level="m">Wolf Willow</title> (1962), marry each author's personal
feelings for the Plains with a recounted history
of the region. <title level="m">Wolf Willow</title>, the most sustained
and complex Great Plains autobiographical
memoir, is a profound articulation of the recalled
meanings made and found in a single
landscape, felt by a single person: "If I am
native to anything," Stegner sees at one point,
"I am native to this." And, because the Iowaborn
Stegner wrote about the Plains borderland
region of south Saskatchewan where he
grew up, Wolf Willow remains better regarded
in Canada than in the United States. It need
not be, for the book is a paradigm of the Great
Plains autobiographical memoir, capturing its
most frequently seen characteristics.</p>
