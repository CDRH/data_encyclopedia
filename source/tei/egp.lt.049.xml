<head type="main">MOUNTIE STORIES</head>

<p>Mountie stories were once the most popular
adventure fiction of the Canadian Prairies, but
by the 1950s they were overtaken by history and
changing fashion. Soon after they came west,
the North-West Mounted Police were discovered
by the international entertainment industry,
with nineteenth-century adventure
writers creating various romantic images of
the force. British writers such as John Mackie
and Harold Bindloss depicted Mounties as
well-bred Englishmen defending the ideals of
empire. The Mounties of American writers
such as James Oliver Curwood were U.S. marshals
in red tunics, given to shootouts and extralegal
justice. By contrast, the Canadian
Mountie hero popularized by Charles Gordon
and Gilbert Parker could ride into a hostile
Indian camp and arrest the chief 's son without
unholstering his weapon because he eschewed
violence: his uncanny power resided not in
himself but in the empire he symbolized.</p>

<p>Mountie stories appeared regularly through
the 1940s, but by 1930 virtually none were
being published in Canada. Canadian publishers
were losing interest probably because,
with Canada's growing independence, a hero
embodying a discarded myth of empire was
an embarrassment. The fictional Mountie was
left largely to Hollywood, which had already
produced more than 200 movies projecting
the American image of the force. Aside from
historical studies, Mounties in Canada usually
feature in ironic or satiric sketches on radio or
television. The crowning irony may be the sale
of the rights to the Mountie image to the Disney
Corporation in 1995, completing the circle
of an old British colonial symbol absorbed in
the new American colonization of Canadian
culture.</p>
