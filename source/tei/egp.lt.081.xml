<head type="main">WIEBE, RUDY (b. 1934)</head>

<p>Canadian author Rudy Wiebe was born on
October 4, 1934, near Fairholme, Saskatchewan,
four years after his parents emigrated from Russia.
Growing up in a German-speaking community,
Wiebe did not learn English until he attended
school.</p>

<p>Wiebe's best-known novels are set in the
Canadian Prairies and explore the lives of
Mennonites, his own people, as well as those
of historic First Nations and M&#233;tis leaders and
contemporary Canadians who struggle to understand
their regional, cultural, and personal
history. <title level="m">Peace Shall Destroy Many</title> (1962) describes
a community in Saskatchewan during
World War II. <title level="m">The Blue Mountains of China</title>
(1970) traces the migrations of Mennonite refugees
from Russia to China, South America,
and Canada, where a contemporary Mennonite
demonstrates his faith by carrying a
cross beside the Prairie highway. In his next
two novels, <title level="m">The Temptations of Big Bear</title> (1973)
and <title level="m">The Scorched-Wood People</title> (1977), Wiebe
focuses on events culminating in the 1885 rebellion
that led to the arrests of Native leaders
Big Bear and Poundmaker and to the execution
of Louis Riel. <title level="m">The Temptations of Big Bear</title>, which won the 1973 Governor General's
Literary Award for fiction, is often considered
Wiebe's masterpiece. Among his other works
are <title level="m">A Discovery of Strangers</title> (1994), an epic
novel about the first Franklin expedition into
the Canadian Northwest, which also won a
Governor General's Literary Award for fiction;
collections of short stories, including
<title level="m">River of Stone: Fiction and Memories</title> (1995); a
novella about Albert Johnson called <title level="m">The Mad Trapper</title> (1980); a play about the Prairies called
<title level="m">Far as the Eye Can See</title> (1977); essays; and the
autobiographical work, <title level="m">Playing Dead: A Contemplation Concerning the Arctic</title> (1989), in
which Wiebe meditates upon the power of
stories to create identity and a sense of place.</p>

<p>Wiebe has taught English and creative writing
at the University of Alberta since 1967. In
1987 he was awarded the Royal Society of Canada's
Lorne Pierce Medal.</p>
