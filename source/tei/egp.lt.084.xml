<p>Even though Larry Woiwode moved out of
North Dakota when he was eight and did not
return to live there until 1978, he is imbued
with the "Dakota mystique"&#8211;a sense of awe at
the vast land, a need for family and community,
and an awareness of and a faith in God
that helps people there survive. Two of his
novels (<title level="m">Beyond the Bedroom Wall: A Family Album</title>, 1975; <title level="m">Born Brothers</title>, 1988), a number
of his short stories, and some of his poems
focus on North Dakota people and on the
Northern Plains experience. Whether a specific
work is set in North Dakota or not, a
sense of place, of family, and of God permeates
Woiwode's writing, especially in his semi-autobiographical
<title level="m">Beyond the Bedroom Wall</title>.
One reads this novel as if paging through a
family picture album full of places, biographical
vignettes, fragments of memories, and
longer reminiscences that leave the reader curious
about the characters and incidents recorded
in the "snapshots." Parts 1 and 2, set in
rural North Dakota, trace the history of the
family through four generations, until they
move to Illinois.</p>

<p>As of 1998, Woiwode had written three
other novels (<title level="m">What I'm Going to Do, I Think</title>,
1969; <title level="m">Poppa John</title>, 1981; <title level="m">Indian Affairs</title>, 1992),
two volumes of short stories (<title level="m">The Neumiller Stories</title>, 1989; <title level="m">Silent Passengers</title>, 1993), and two
of poetry (<title level="m">Poetry North: Five Poets of North Dakota</title>, 1970; <title level="m">Even Tide</title>, 1977). In addition
to published interviews, Woiwode has short
stories, poems, and nonfiction pieces that
have not yet been collected. Woiwode is a
careful craftsman, a compelling storyteller,
and a stylist with a gift for both lyrical and
precise expression.</p>
