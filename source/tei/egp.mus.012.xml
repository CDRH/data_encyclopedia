<head type="main">COWBOY MUSIC</head>

<p>Cowboy music is a folk idiom whose musical
progenitors include British ballads, familiar
European melodies, Mexican and Spanish influences,
and the tunes and traditions of
America's mountains, rural areas, and southern
states. It emerged just after the Civil War
with the establishment of the "open range cattle
kingdom" in the Great Plains.</p>

<p>Longhorn cattle were plentiful in Texas, and
in the summer of 1867 entrepreneurs began
driving herds north along the Chisholm Trail
to the railhead in Abilene, Kansas, for shipment
to eastern markets. Many more cattle
drives followed during the ensuing two decades,
and by the 1880s the drives extended as
far north as Wyoming and Montana, where
rich grazing lands on the open range were
plentiful. Though the tradition of cowboy
music established during those years continues
to the present, a majority of the older
songs date from approximately 1870 to 1920.
Thereafter, the media (via sheet music, recordings,
radio, movies, and television) became
a potent force in shaping the idiom and
people's ideas about it.</p>

<p>Authentic cowboy songs tell the story of the
cattlemen, their often solitary way of life,
the animals they rode, herded, and guarded
against, and the wide expanse of the Great
Plains and American West where they worked.
Some of the tunes were functional, like the
night-herding songs of cowboys who circled
the herd as it lay on the bedding ground.
These melodies reassured the restive cattle and
helped prevent night noises and events from
causing a stampede. Other tunes extolled the
lives and abilities of cowboys, real and mythical,
eulogized those killed in their labors, or
celebrated animals that got the better of their
human companions. These include "The Old
Chisholm Trail," perhaps the most popular
song of the Old West, "The Educated Feller"
("Zebra Dun"), which was sung to the tune
of "Son of a Gambolier," "Sam Bass," "The
Grand Round Up" ("The Cowboy's Sweet By
and By"), whose melody was "My Bonnie Lies
over the Ocean," "Little Joe the Wrangler,"
which used the tune of "The Little Old Log
Cabin in the Lane," "Whoopie Ti Yi Yo,"
"Goodbye Old Paint," "Windy Bill," and "The
Cowboy's Lament." The songs were usually
sung by individuals, not groups, and were
constantly reshaped and added to according
to the particular tastes of the performers.
Poems with Western or cowboy themes appeared
regularly in journals, newspapers, and
magazines, and many of these were set to music.
Often, the words of a given song, poem, or
narrative were sung to more than one tune.
Cowboy song melodies were often rather simple,
using few pitches. Some were pentatonic
(using but five different note names), while
others had strong triadic (a chord of three
tones a third apart) underpinnings. Most importantly,
the tunes cowboys favored were
easily singable and suitable for the lyrics,
which in their original form were sometimes
colorful and earthy.</p>

<p>Cowboy music represents a rich and unique
part of American cultural life. It is the music
that we associate with the American West and
represents the musings of countless individuals
who worked, slept, ate, and sometimes
died on the open prairie.</p>
