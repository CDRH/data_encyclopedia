<p>Singer and songwriter k. d. lang was born
Kathryn Dawn Lang on November 2, 1962, in
Edmonton, Alberta. Raised in the small town
of Consort, she studied music for a year after
high school and began performing professionally
in Edmonton in 1981. Her recording career
began with <title>A Truly Western Experience</title> in 1984
with her band, the Reclines. Claiming Patsy
Cline as an alter ego, she cultivated an unconventional,
occasionally frenetic, and irreverent
stage presence during this period in her career.
In 1984 she made her U.S. debut and began to
tour internationally. Signed to Sire Records,
she released <title>Angel with a Lariat</title> and <title>Shadowland</title>
in 1987. "Crying," her duet with Roy Orbison,
won her a Grammy in 1988 for best
country music collaboration. Absolute Torch and Twang, released in 1989, sold 100,000
copies in Canada and 500,000 in the United
States and earned her a Grammy in 1990 for
best female country vocalist. In Canada she
won three Juno Awards from 1987 to 1990.</p>

<p>Although clearly in the mainstream of country
music, as demonstrated by the Grammys,
Grammy nominations, and awards from the
Canadian Country Music Association, lang
has suggested that her music, along with that
of many other Canadian country musicians,
differs in subtle ways from the homogeneous
Nashville product because of the ethnic influences&#8211;
Irish, Scottish, Ukrainian&#8211;found on
the Canadian Prairies. Three albums appeared
in the 1990s: <title>Ingenue</title> (1992), <title>All You Can Eat</title>
(1995), and <title>Drag</title> (1997). They represent a significant
change in lang's musical style, described
by one writer as country-punk turned
pop-torch chanteuse. Unifying and to some
extent determining the nature of the change
has been her instrument, her voice: rich, flexible,
and superbly controlled.</p>
