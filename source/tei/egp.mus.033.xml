<p>The National Music Museum is one of the great
museums of its kind in the world. Housed in a
carefully restored Carnegie library building on
the campus of the University of South Dakota in
Vermillion, the museum's ever-growing collections
of more than 7,000 American, European,
and non-Western instruments are the most inclusive
in the world, rivaled only by similar
museums in Berlin, Paris, Oxford, Rome, and
Vienna. Included are many of the earliest, best-preserved,
and historically most important
musical instruments known to survive, along
with an extensive library of rare books and
archival materials.</p>

<p>The museum serves the people of the Great
Plains and the nation as an international center
for collecting and conserving musical instruments
of all cultures and bringing people
together to study, enjoy, and understand our
diverse musical heritage.</p>

<p>It has a special responsibility to preserve
musical instruments that were either imported
to or built in the United States, with
emphasis on the musical traditions of the
Northern Great Plains. The museum's American
musical instrument manufacturers archives
has no rival. Complete band libraries
from small towns in the region are preserved,
along with many unique resources such as the
handwritten manuscripts of the music composed
by General Custer's bandmaster, Felix
Vinatieri (1834–91); the compositions of one
of the region's first serious female composers,
Marjorie Eastwood Dudley (1891–1961); and
the musical arrangements of Stan Fritts (1910–
69) and the Korn Kobblers.</p>

<p>Museum facilities also include a specialized
library, state-of-the-art conservation laboratory,
and extensive study and storage areas.</p>
