<p>Charles Parker Jr. was born in Kansas City,
Kansas, on August 29, 1920. When he was
seven, Charlie moved with his mother, Addie,
to Kansas City, Missouri, which was growing
at a boomtown rate. From 1925 to 1938 Kansas
City was run by notorious Democratic machine
boss Tom Pendergast. Pendergast's machine
chose to ignore the prohibition on alcohol
imposed by the Volsted Act. Kansas
City's bars, nightclubs, and cabarets flourished
twenty-four hours a day, providing fertile
ground for the emergence of a distinctive
blues-based jazz style. Thus, while Parker
was receiving his formal education at Crispus
Attucks Public School and Old Lincoln High
School, he was also receiving his early musical
education and inspiration outside famous
clubs near 18th and Vine, like the Reno Club
and Lucille's Paradise Band Box, listening
to the legendary orchestras of Count Basie,
Bennie Moten, and Walter Page's Blue Devils.
Some say it was this early proclivity for "hanging
out" that gave Parker the nickname "Yardbird"
(a slang term for chicken), later shortened
to "Bird," a more fitting description
for the soaring, high-flying artist he was to
become.</p>

<p>Bird's chosen instrument was the alto saxophone,
but he showed little obvious musical
promise with it in his early years. In fact,
a famous jazz anecdote has Basie's drummer
hurling a cymbal at the young Parker after a
particularly ragged solo. At the age of sixteen,
after an intensive period of musical study
while performing at a resort in the Ozarks,
Parker returned home to take the Kansas City
music scene by storm. In the late thirties and
early forties Parker played with a number of
prominent Kansas City ensembles, most notably
the Jay McShann Orchestra; but by 1942
Bird had moved his base of operations to New
York City. There he emerged as perhaps the
single most important creative figure in the
birth of what came to be called modern jazz
or bebop.</p>

<p>Collaborating with similar-minded musicians,
most notably, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious
Monk, Bud Powell, Charles Mingus, and
Max Roach, Parker revolutionized the art of
jazz composition and soloing. As Louis Armstrong
had done before him, Bird influenced
all of the serious younger jazz musicians of his
day, regardless of their chosen instrument.
Parker's rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic innovations
proved pivotal in changing the primarily
dance-oriented swing jazz of the thirties
and forties in the direction of full-blown
art music. While many of his compositions are
thought to have been created in the most casual
of circumstances, such as during taxi rides
or recording sessions, compositions such as
"Confirmation," "Donna Lee," and "Now's the
Time'' remain central to the repertoire of jazz
standards.</p>

<p>Charlie Parker was perhaps the greatest genius
jazz has known. He successfully toured
Europe and the United States, his recordings
eventually sold millions of copies, and he was
so revered in jazz circles during his lifetime
that a major jazz club&#8211;Birdland&#8211;was named
in his honor. He became a patron saint of
the Beat generation immortalized in Jack Kerouac's
<title level="m">On the Road</title> (1957), and he was the
subject of a major Hollywood film tribute,
<title>Bird</title> (1988), directed by devoted fan Clint
Eastwood. Charlie Parker's genius was tragically
short-lived. He died in New York City
on March 12, 1955, from complications resulting
from long-term substance abuse. Charlie
Parker and his mother lie side by side in Lincoln
Cemetery, Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
