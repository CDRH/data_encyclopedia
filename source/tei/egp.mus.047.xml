<p>Ernest Dale Tubb, popular and influential
country music singer, was born in Crisp in
rural Ellis County, Texas (near Dallas), the
youngest of five children in a sharecropping
family. His family picked cotton there during
the prosperous World War I years and then in
about 1920 moved west to the High Plains,
pulling cotton in and around Benjamin, Texas.
Cowboy music performed by Jules Verne Allen
and others was one early influence on Tubb,
but his main formative influence was the music
of recording star Jimmie Rodgers. Later,
while working a succession of radio jobs in San
Antonio, San Angelo, Corpus Christi, and Fort
Worth, Tubb was influenced by contemporaries
such as Rex Griffin, Tommy Duncan, Al
Dexter, Floyd Tillman, Ted Daffan, and Moon
Mullican. He failed as a Jimmie Rodgers clone
on Bluebird Records (1936-37) but developed
his own warm, drawling, honky-tonk singing
style and a growing following through selfwritten
song hits on Decca Records after 1940,
especially 1941's "Walking the Floor over You."</p>

<p>Tubb worked in four Hollywood films of
the 1940s&#8211;two Charles Starrett Westerns for
Columbia Pictures and two musical variety
films&#8211;and moved his base of operations from
Texas to Nashville's <title>Grand Ole Opry</title> in 1943.
He remained one of the show's biggest stars
for the rest of his career and is legendary
for the professional helping hand he extended
to others, including Hank Williams, Hank
Snow, Charlie Walker, Johnny Cash, Stonewall
Jackson, the Wilburn Brothers, George Hamilton
IV, duet partner Loretta Lynn, and
his own one-time Texas Troubadours bandsmen
Jack Greene and Cal Smith. Emphysema
ended his long career in 1982, and two years
later, on September 6, 1984, in Nashville, it
took his life. During his seventy years he won
all the honors the country music world can
bestow, including election in 1965 as the sixth
member of the Country Music Hall of Fame.</p>
