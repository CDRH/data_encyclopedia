<p>Neil Young's forty-year career has established
him as one of the most productive and influential
folk and rock musicians in North America.
Young was born in Toronto, Ontario, on
November 12, 1945, the son of Scott Young, an
acclaimed Canadian sportswriter. When his
parents' marriage dissolved in 1960, Young
moved west to Winnipeg, Manitoba, with his
mother, Rassy. It was in Winnipeg that the
adolescent Young became a musician, first
nurtured at the piano of his talented and progressive
mother and later plugging in an electric
guitar when rock and roll emerged as a
major musical genre.</p>

<p>Growing up in Winnipeg, Young felt not
only the pop influence of the British Invasion
and the lyrical focus of folk music but also the
strains of rockabilly and country twang that
blew in from the Prairies. Young spoke of his
modest Winnipeg upbringing during a 1999
concert in Minneapolis, noting, "I grew up a
bit north of here. This was the Emerald City
to me." After playing in several high school
bands in Winnipeg, Young sought to advance
his career first in Fort William and Toronto
before heading west to California in 1966.
There he joined the folk rock band Buffalo
Springfield, and he has been one of rock's stars
ever since.</p>

<p>With more than fifty albums to his credit,
Young has embraced many musical styles and
performed with a diverse assortment of collaborators,
yet two particular sounds stand out:
his acoustic compositions, which date back to
his folk music days in Canada, and the bold
electrical offerings created with his longtime
backup band, Crazy Horse. Young's acoustic
songs blend his distinctive highly pitched vocals
with multilayered guitar chords punctuated
with bass runs. Young adds a plaintive
harmonica to many of his acoustic songs and
provides competent backup on the piano and
an antique pump organ. When backed by
Crazy Horse, Young's music takes on a different
personality, with a powerful guitar
sound that is part Americana, part blues, and
part grunge. Young's electrical guitar roams
freely over the music with full, rich chords and
piercing solos. Young is a superbly accomplished
guitarist whose mastery is best appreciated
in live performances.</p>

<p>Young's songs are often composed of fragmented
phrases and juxtaposed verses that
seldom stand alone as poetry yet when combined
with his music take on an evocative
meaning that transcends words. An example
of this is Young's "Ohio." Written in 1970, the
day after National Guard troops killed four
protestors at Kent State University and recorded
with Crosby, Stills and Nash, the song
hit the airwaves within a week of the shootings
and became an instant anthem for the antiwar
movement. Young had been reluctant to embrace
the antiwar cause to the extent of many
of his folk music contemporaries, and his later
political sentiments were as scattered as his
musical styles. Still, his songwriting expertise
is evident in this minimalist song that so well
captures the heart and soul of the matter.</p>

<p>Young's rural roots and populist tendencies
are evident in his passionate involvement in
Farm Aid, an annual concert event initiated in
1985 with fellow musicians Willie Nelson and
John Mellencamp. Young's commitment to
this cause is evident in his extensive onstage
discourses on the plight of family farms. This
is a marked departure from his usual stage
demeanor, which is intensely focused on his
music and seldom includes more than a few
obligatory greetings thrown in between songs.
With two sons suffering from birth defects,
Young and his wife, Peggi, have also organized
the annual Bridge concert since 1986, supporting
a San Francisco-area school for severely
handicapped children.</p>

<p>Young has twice been inducted into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, first in 1995 as a
solo artist and in 1997 as a member of Buffalo
Springfield.</p>
