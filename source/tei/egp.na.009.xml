<head type="main">ASSINIBOINES</head>

<p>The Assiniboines (the western portion in Alberta
are called Stoneys) refer to themselves
as <hi rend="italic">Nakota</hi>. They are Siouan speakers, linguistically
situated in the Dakota-Lakota-Stoney
language continuum. They have been distinct
dialectically since before the sixteenth century,
and 250 years of enmity between Assiniboines
and Sioux peoples resulted in many Assiniboines
denying that they were ever Sioux.
Their closest allies were the Crees and, later, the
Ojibwas. The name Assiniboine comes from
the Ojibwa <hi rend="italic">assini-pwa-n</hi>, or "stone enemy."</p>

<p>First noted by Europeans in the <hi rend="italic">Jesuit Relations</hi>
of 1640, Assiniboines were reported in
1658 to be living 100 miles west of Lake Nipigon
and trading in the western Lake Superior
regions. Other Assiniboines were encountered
on the northern Prairies by Hudson's Bay
Company trader and explorer Henry Kelsey in
1690–91 as far west as the Red Deer River in
the Rocky Mountain foothills. During the
winter of 1754–55, Anthony Henday of Hudson's
Bay Company in central Alberta was assisted
by "Assiniboine" families who were certainly
those farthest west, antecedents of the
contemporary Stoneys.</p>

<p>Their geographic concentrations in the seventeenth
century included the areas continuously
westward from Lake Winnipeg into central
Saskatchewan. The Mortlach Aggregate
archeological tradition has been identified in
this region as representing the prehistoric and
protohistoric Assiniboine. The first accounts
of Assiniboines from the mid–eighteenth century
report portions of groups active as middlemen
and transporters in the initial postcontact
trade networks. La V&#233;rendrye joined an
Assiniboine trade expedition to the Mandan
villages on the Missouri River in 1738. A portion
of the population participated in tribal
and intertribal transport expeditions from the
interior to Hudson Bay. Other portions of the
population were hunters and gatherers, living
on processing bison into provisions or, in the
case of the Stoney populations, utilizing the
variety of resources of the Rocky Mountain
foothills. The Stoney territories were reached
by competing traders in the 1770s. By 1780 Assiniboines
were no longer ranging east of the
Forks of the Red River of the North and the
Assiniboine River; instead their eastern territories
became the confluence of the Souris
and Assiniboine Rivers and the White Earth
River valley to the Missouri.</p>

<p>The Assiniboine subsistence round primarily
exploited the parklands between forest
and prairie and a series of microclimates found
throughout the forests and prairies. The drainages
of the Saskatchewan and Assiniboine
Rivers to the North, the Milk River in the west,
and the Missouri to the south framed their
homelands. Bison and other large game were
primarily hunted, with smaller animals and a
wide range of flora rounding out the food resources
before annuities and commercial provisions.
Bison skin was the major substance for
clothing and for making tipi covers for shelter.</p>

<p>Assiniboine social organization involved
autonomous bands, each comprising a group
of families who camped together. Many were
related by blood and marriage. Consequently,
the band was both the basic political and economic
social unit and completely sovereign.
Individual a.liation was theoretically flexible,
and although kinship bound members to one
another, new bands and new headmen could
emerge. This caused bands to fragment, as individuals
and families realigned themselves to
the new social formation. The political order
was headed by a group of senior males who
comprised the <hi rend="italic">hungabi</hi>, or "little chiefs," and
from among them a <hi rend="italic">hunga</hi> was chosen to be
the executor of this council's will. Senior warriors
led the <hi rend="italic">agi'cita</hi>, or "soldiers' society," and
they were empowered by the hungabi to fulfill
specific tasks that were within their authority.</p>

<p>Assiniboine religion utilizes the longstemmed
pipe, which is the fundamental element
in all ceremonies: vision quests, sweat
lodges, the Sun Dance (which they call the
"Tibi Tanga," or "Big Lodge," also translated
as "Medicine Lodge"), hand games (a divinational
form of the Pawnee Ghost Dance complex),
and feasts, including the Ghost Feast,
held within four days of a person's death and
during subsequent memorials. Participants in
all of these contexts make themselves humble,
asking others to pray for them. Individuals
pray for their kinsmen and friends and ask
that their collective and personal wishes, desires,
or vows be fulfilled. A spirit world of
helpers is called upon in prayer to prescribe
action. Shamans with special powers mediate
interpretations and lead ceremonies.</p>

<p>Contemporary Assiniboine life signals an
interest in the revival of religious ceremonies
and preservation of their language. This has
occurred in part because increased numbers of
individuals seek advanced education and follow
careers that remove them from their reserve
communities. Consequently, these communities
have become self-reflective about
how effectively to reproduce the language and
culture in future generations and how best to
coordinate or balance individual development
and community development, which is mostly
economic and cultural.</p>

<p>Estimates of the historic Assiniboine population
give a total of 10,000, prior to their decline
by as much as half due to the 1780.81
smallpox pandemic. Subsequent recoveries
were offset by other disease episodes that left
the Assiniboines with fewer than 5,000 individuals
on the eve of reserves and reservations
in the 1870s. Numbers continued to dwindle as
adjustment was made to a sedentary way of life
on reservations in the United States after 1873
and on reserves in Canada after 1874. Shortly
after 1900, the population began a steady increase
to the present. Contemporary populations
of Assiniboine communities in Montana,
based on the 1990 census are: Fort Belknap,
2,180 (with Atsinas, Gros Ventres, and others
resident and enrolled) and Fort Peck, 5,782
(with Sioux and others resident and enrolled).
The resident and enrolled populations on
Saskatchewan reserves, based on the 1998
census, are: Carry the Kettle, 1,924; Lean Man/
Grizzly Bear's Head/Mosquito, 1,042 (with
Crees); White Bear, 1,782, (with Crees); Ocean
Man, 321; and Pheasant's Rump, 302. The 1998
populations (on and off reserve) for the Alberta
reserves are: Southern Stoney communities
at Morley, 3,598 (from among the Bearspaw,
Chiniki, and Wesley Bands); the same
bands at Eden Valley, 479, and at Big Horn, 133;
and Northern Stoney communities at Alexis,
1,274, and Paul, 1438.</p>

<p>Important historic leaders include Crazy
Bear, who headed the delegation to the 1851 Fort
Laramie Treaty Council; Red Stone among the
lower Assiniboines in the same period, who led
in the transition to reservations in the mid- to
late nineteenth century; and Chiefs Jacob Bearspaw,
John Chiniki, and Jacob Goodstoney who
were the Stoney signers of Treaty Number 7 in
Canada in September of 1877. The earliest documentation
of oral history and folklore was by
Edwin Thompson Denig in the early 1850s, and
the earliest ethnographies were by Robert H.
Lowie (1909) and David Rodnick (1938).</p>
