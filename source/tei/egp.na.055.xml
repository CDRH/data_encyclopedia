<head type="main">KIOWAS</head>

<p>The Kiowas believe that they originated in the
Bitterroot Mountains of present-day Montana.
They now call themselves <hi rend="italic">K'oigu</hi>, the
"Principal People." Earlier names, <hi rend="italic">Kwuda</hi>, or
<hi rend="italic">T'epda</hi>, "Coming-Out People," commemorate
the Kiowa creation story, when Saynday,
the Kiowa trickster, transformed the subterranean-
living Kiowas into ants, then commanded
them to populate the earth's surface
via a hollow cottonwood log. A pregnant
woman became lodged in the log, preventing
the majority of the ant-people from emerging;
hence the small nineteenth century population
of approximately 1,000 to 1,100 Kiowas.</p>

<p>Besides Saynday, other mythological culture
heroes include the <hi rend="italic">Zaidethali</hi>, or "Split
Boys," who slew numerous monsters before
one disappeared forever and the other transformed
himself into the eucharistic <hi rend="italic">Thali-dai</hi>,
or "Boy Medicines," known today as the Ten
Medicines. During the height of the horse and
buffalo culture (ca. 1750 to 1875), these sacred
bundles were possessed by ten keepers whose
main duty was to pray for the well-being of
the people and to settle civil disputes.</p>

<p>Sometime in the mid.eighteenth century,
the Kiowas and culturally a.liated Plains
Apaches migrated from the Yellowstone River
region southeastward toward the Black Hills
and befriended the Crows. Between 1775 and
1805 the Kiowas and Plains Apaches were
pushed farther south of the Black Hills by
Lakotas and Cheyennes. Migrating south to
the horse-rich Southern Plains, they initially
came into conflict with the more numerous
Comanches. After about 1800, however, the
Kiowas, Comanches, and Plains Apaches (later
referred to as <hi rend="smallcaps">KCA</hi> Indians) made an alliance
and followed the migratory bison herds between
the Arkansas and Red Rivers.</p>

<p>Mid-nineteenth-century Kiowa society
consisted of ten to twenty hunting bands, each
composed of several extended family groups,
or kindreds. Each kindred was led by the oldest
of a group of brothers, and each band was
led by the most prominent man among the
coalesced kindreds&#8211;the <hi rend="italic">topadok'i</hi>, or "main
chief." The Kiowas recognized four classes: <hi rend="italic">ondedau</hi>,
or "rich" people; the <hi rend="italic">ondegup'a</hi>, "second
best"; the <hi rend="italic">kwwn</hi>, "poor"; and the <hi rend="italic">dapom</hi>,
or "worthless." Relatives were separated by sex
and generation; for example, all cousins were
classified as "brothers" and "sisters."</p>

<p>Until about 1847 the Kiowas and Plains
Apaches occupied present-day western Oklahoma,
southwestern Kansas, and the Texas
Panhandle. Winter and summer camps were
located on branches of the Red, Washita,
South Canadian, and North Canadian Rivers.
From this core region, intertribal war parties
raided south into Texas and Mexico and
southwest into present-day New Mexico. Pawnees,
Navajos, Utes, Mexicans, and Texans
were common enemies. In the Treaty of Fort
Gibson of May 26, 1837, for example, signed
by ten Kiowa leaders, including the famous
Dohausan, principal Kiowa chief between 1833
and 1866, the Kiowas agreed not to raid the
Santa Fe Trail and to guarantee safe passage of
all Americans crossing the Southern Plains.</p>

<p>Between 1848 and 1868 the Kiowas expanded
their territory north and west into central
Kansas and southeastern Colorado. During
this period, winter and summer camps were
located along the Great Bend of the Arkansas
River in Kansas and at the confluence of Wolf
Creek and the North Canadian River in northwestern
Oklahoma. This northward migration
resulted from the expansion of Texas settlements
and the arrival of immigrant tribes in
eastern Kansas and the Indian Territory. Conflicts
with the Pawnees and immigrant tribes
were inevitable, because population pressures,
dwindling bison herds, and shrinking territory
in the Central and Southern Plains created
competition for scarce resources. As raiding
into Texas and Mexico for horses and plunder
continued unabated, the Kiowas began kidnapping
children to replace their own children,
who had fallen victims to infectious disease.
Many Kiowas today remark about the
large amount of "captive blood" in the tribe
and maintain that all Kiowas are part Mexican.</p>

<p>On October 21, 1867, the <hi rend="smallcaps">KCA</hi> Indians signed
the Treaty of Medicine Lodge Creek and agreed
to a reservation in present southwestern Oklahoma,
bounded on the north and south by the
Washita and Red Rivers. Although the Kiowas
abandoned Kansas and Colorado in the fall of
1868, they continued to raid into Texas, which
precipitated military action against them. By
the end of the 1874–75 Red River War they
had capitulated. Renowned Kiowa leaders and
warriors were dead or in custody. The remaining
topadok'i were demoted to "beef chiefs," in
charge of annuity distributions to the former
bands, which were now confined in a single
village near Fort Sill. The Southern Plains
bison herds were extinct by the late 1870s, leaving
the Kiowas completely dependent on the
government for their subsistence. Most attempts
to transform Kiowas into stock herders
and farmers failed, so famine persisted during
the 1880s and 1890s. Further changes occurred
after the Jerome Agreement of 1892, which
brought about the allotment of <hi rend="smallcaps">KCA</hi> lands.
Since the "opening" of the Kiowa Reservation
to homesteaders on August 6, 1901, the Kiowas
have lived on individual allotments north of
the Wichita Mountains, bounded on the west
by the town of Lone Wolf and on the east by
Anadarko.</p>

<p>Nineteenth-century Kiowa cosmology was
based on the concept of <hi rend="italic">daudau</hi>, or "power," a
spirit force that permeated the universe and
all natural entities, such as earth, air, mountains,
plants, and animals. Power seekers endured
vision quests in the Wichita Mountains
and other high elevations; the fortunate few
who received power visions became great warriors,
or curers who painted power symbols
on their shields. Before the reservation period
several shield societies were in existence, but
they died out after 1875. The Sun Dance, the
most important Kiowa ceremony, was performed
to regenerate the Kiowas and the bison
herds. Held in mid-June only if pledged
by <hi rend="italic">ondedau</hi> men, the four dancing days of the
ceremony culminated in the final day when
the sacred Taime, or Sun Dance bundle, was
hung in the forked pole of the Sun Dance altar
to bless all tribal members.</p>

<p>Government intervention brought about
the demise of the Sun Dance. Although the
aborted 1890 Sun Dance "when the forked
poles were left standing" marked the death of
the Sun Dance religion, the Kiowas turned to
the Ghost Dance, which ended in 1891, but
was brought back between 1894 and 1916. Missionaries
came to Kiowa country in 1887, and
by 1918, when the Native American Church of
Oklahoma was chartered, most Kiowas were
either Christians or peyotists. Today, there
are a handful of Kiowa peyote Roadmen, but
most Kiowas are Baptist, Methodist, or Pentecostal.
Medicine bundle inheritance broke
down in the twentieth century, but the eleven
tribal bundles&#8211;the Thali-da-i and Taime&#8211;
are still sought out with prayer requests. Despite
vast cultural and religious change in the
last century, the Kiowas believe that <hi rend="italic">daudau</hi>
still exists in many guises, and that <hi rend="italic">Dauk'i</hi>, or
"God," is in everything.</p>

<p>Approximately 4,000 Kiowas now live in
western Oklahoma, and another 6,000 live
elsewhere in the United States. Kiowas are
very much involved in intertribal powwows
and cultural activities that promote their tribal
identity. Tribal offices are located in Carnegie,
Oklahoma, and at the Bureau of Indian
Affairs in Anadarko. Kiowa tribal government,
chartered by a constitution, consists of
a business committee and a tribal chair. Contemporary
Kiowas of note include N. Scott
Momaday, 1969 Pulitzer Prize winner for literature,
and Everett Rhoades, former assistant
surgeon general of the United States.</p>
