<head type="main">GARNER, ELMER (1864-1944)</head>

<p>Born in Tama County, Iowa, on January 1, 1864,
but raised near Downs in Osborne County,
Kansas, Elmer J. Garner was an editor and
publisher of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth century who moved from Farmers
Alliance advocacy in 1890 to the radical "old
Christian right" of fellow Kansans Dr. John R.
Brinkley and Rev. Gerald B. Winrod. Garner
edited papers identified with the People's,
Republican, and Democratic Parties, even
though he claimed political independence. By
some accounts his <title level="j">Farmers' Advance</title> (Almena,
Norton County) was the first Populist newspaper
in Kansas, but during the 1890s Garner's
<title level="j">Logan Republican</title> also supported prohibitionists
and free-silver Democrats such as William
Jennings Bryan, as well as many Republican
candidates. Despite his chameleonic politics,
Garner consistently espoused prohibitionism,
nativism, and isolationism; he also frequently
employed anti-British, anti-Catholic, and
anti-Semitic rhetoric in his advocacy of free
silver and farm cooperatives and in his diatribes
against the world financial conspiracy.</p>

<p>After a stint in Oklahoma editing the <title level="j">Oklahoma
State Register</title> (Guthrie) and the <title level="j">Cimarron
Valley Clipper</title> (Coyle), Garner moved back
to Kansas, eventually settling in Emporia,
where he ran a print shop and in the mid-1920s
a newspaper, the <title level="j">Kansas State Bugle</title>, that stood
"one hundred percent for Protestant Americanism"
and supported the activities of the Ku
Klux Klan. Garner then moved to Wichita,
where in 1930 he helped organize that city's
"Brinkley for Governor Club" and launched
<title level="j">Publicity</title>, a four-page weekly tabloid devoted
to Dr. Brinkley and "Brinkleyism." In this, his
final publishing venture, Garner championed
the goat gland doctor's political career and
"populist" platform: free textbooks for Kansas
children; public ownership of natural resources
and utilities, including transportation;
support for strong farmers' cooperative and
trade union movements; prevention of centralized
control of banking, finance, and farming
interests; elimination of war profits; and a
mandatory referendum to precede any declaration
of war. But he also supported much of
the New Deal during the mid-1930s until President
Franklin D. Roosevelt's emphasis shifted
overseas. Editor Garner was virulent in his opposition
to a third term and subsequently
called for the impeachment of "Roosevelt and
his Jewish Camarilla."</p>

<p><title level="j">Publicity</title> softened its anti-Roosevelt message
after Pearl Harbor, but it was too late. The
justice department, through a federal grand
jury, indicted Elmer J. Garner on sedition
charges and eventually put him on trial in
Washington <hi rend="smallcaps">DC</hi> with twenty-nine other defendants.
They were said to have been a part of a
nationwide conspiracy to subvert the country's
armed forces. The "Great Sedition Trial,"
or <title>United States v. McWilliams</title>, ended for the
eighty-year-old Wichita editor on May 4, 1944,
about two weeks after it began, when Garner
died in a Washington boardinghouse.</p>
