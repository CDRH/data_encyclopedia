<head type="main">TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT</head>

<p>The temperance movement arose in the nineteenth
century as a result of high rates of liquor
consumption, consumption that many
observers thought damaging to the individual
drinker, to families, to communities, and to society
as a whole. This movement operated in
both the United States and Canada, as reformers
sought to reduce the volume of alcohol consumption.
The temperance crusade had roots in
the evangelical Protestant churches that sought
to remove barriers to the "right behaviors" leading
to salvation, in this case overconsumption.
There were both separate and common organizations
in the two nations. Especially important
in common was the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union (<hi rend="smallcaps">WCTU</hi>), founded in the United
States in 1874 and organized in Canada that
same year. Each state and province, however,
had other temperance organizations; in the
United States, for example, the Anti-Saloon
League was especially powerful in the first decades
of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Concerned about the human and social
wastage brought about by high rates of alcohol
consumption, temperance advocates worked
to reform the individual drinker. Most typical
in this regard were religious revivals and other
activities of moral persuasion aimed at obtaining
pledges from individuals to reform themselves
by abstaining from alcoholic drink. The
temperance movement soon moved from persuasion
and pledge-taking to legal controls.
Reformers worked for measures to prohibit
businesses from manufacturing, distributing,
and selling alcoholic beverages. Across the
Great Plains, communities turned to "local option"
laws. Later they worked to achieve stateor
provincewide prohibition laws and, eventually,
national laws.</p>

<p>Prohibition was a lively political issue in all
of the Great Plains states and provinces for
many years. In the United States, federal law
applied prohibition to Indian lands from 1834
to 1953. In the 1850s Americans witnessed a
wave of state prohibition measures, most of
which were repealed within a few years. Prohibition
came more permanently to the Great
Plains in 1880, when Kansas adopted state prohibition
in a popular referendum. The experience
in Kansas with prohibition was especially
noteworthy. Although prohibition enjoyed
strong majority support, a minority of citizens
opposed the measure, and illegal distribution
and sale continued, with saloons brazenly operating
in some communities. With prohibition
sentiment building across the nation by
the turn of the twentieth century, some Kansas
citizens sought better enforcement of their antidrink
statute. The state wctu successfully used
nonviolent demonstrations to close some establishments.
Frustrated by continuing illegal operations,
however, Carry Nation achieved national
notoriety in 1900 and 1901 when she
traveled to Kansas communities and physically
smashed saloons and their liquor stocks. Her
controversial actions stirred the prohibition
movement but did little to bring about better
enforcement of the law.</p>

<p>The success of the Kansas prohibition referendum
in 1880 spurred protestors in other
states to enact similar legislation, often with
the active campaigning of the <hi rend="smallcaps">WCTU</hi>. In Texas,
the temperance movement gained strength
with the formation of the United Friends of
Temperance around 1870 and the state wctu in
1883. Local option spread in Texas, although
the state did not enact prohibition laws prior
to the success of the national movement. In
1889 North Dakota became the first state to
enter the union under prohibition legislation.
Oklahoma also entered as a dry state in 1907, so
powerful were its temperance reformers. By
1917 all of the Great Plains states except Texas
and Wyoming had enacted prohibition laws.
The United States enacted national prohibition
under the Eighteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, in effect from January 16, 1920,
until December 6, 1933, when it was repealed
by the Twenty-first Amendment. In the United
States, with the end of national prohibition,
the repeal movement swept the Great Plains
states. Kansas held onto prohibition until 1948
and Oklahoma until 1959.</p>

<p>In Canada, although the Prairie Provinces by
1900 provided for restrictions on alcohol sales,
the situation was complicated because the federal
government retained the right to regulate
the manufacture of alcoholic beverages. Eventually,
by popular referendum, prohibition was
adopted in Alberta (1915), Manitoba (1916),
and Saskatchewan (1917). Prohibition, however,
proved short-lived in the Canadian provinces.
By 1925 the three Prairie provinces had abandoned
prohibition in favor of sales under strict
government control.</p>
