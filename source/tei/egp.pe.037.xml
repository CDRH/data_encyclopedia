<head type="main">MESQUITE</head>

<p>Mesquite (genus <hi rend="italic">Prosopis</hi>; family Fabaceae) is
a thorny, woody shrub or tree that inhabits
many arid and semiarid regions around the
world. Honey mesquite (<hi rend="italic">P. glandulosa</hi>) is native
to the Southern Great Plains and is found
in central and West Texas, western Oklahoma,
and eastern New Mexico. It has increased in
density and distribution since the late 1800s.
Reasons for the increase are controversial but
may include livestock grazing, reduction of fire
frequency, climatic change, and increased atmospheric
carbon dioxide. Mesquite is widely
regarded as a noxious plant because of its interference
with livestock production. Control
efforts since the 1930s have included herbicide,
mechanical, and prescribed fire treatments.
Recent research suggests the potential benefits
of mesquite if managed as a low-density savanna
plant. Such benefits include wildlife
habitat, livestock shading, nitrogen fixation,
and wood products.</p>

<p>Seedpods of this legume are high in soluble
carbohydrates and are consumed by wildlife
and domestic livestock. Germination is enhanced
by animal ingestion and fecal deposition.
Most initial growth is toward taproot
development. Potential growth form is fewstemmed
and arboreal, but destruction of
aboveground tissue stimulates sprouting from
meristem at stem bases and causes a multistemmed,
thorny growth. Leaves are bipinnately
compound, winter-deciduous, and unpalatable;
flowering is monoecious.</p>

<p>Mesquite is adapted to a variety of soils and
environments and can grow a deep taproot as
well as extensive shallow lateral roots. Water
use can be phreatophytic (drawing from the
water table or just above it), but mesquite will
also grow on shallow-water sites and tolerate
droughts by minimizing transpiration. Capacity
to enrich soil fertility through nitrogen
fixation and canopy shading may significantly
alter flora beneath canopies. Mesquite may
serve as a host plant, facilitating establishment
of other plant species. Generally, dense stands
of mesquite reduce growth of herbaceous
plants. Dense stands are thought to reduce
off-site water yield, but no studies have yet
verified this.</p>
