<head type="main">PALLISER'S TRIANGLE</head>

<p>James Hector, a member of the British expedition
of 1857–60 to the western interior of Canada,
led by Capt. James Palliser, described the
"arid district" of the Canadian Prairies as "a
triangular region," with its apex reaching 52
north latitude and its base extending from 100
west to 114 west along the U.S. border (49
north latitude). This is the genesis of the term
"Palliser's Triangle," which is still widely used.
The cities of Lethbridge and Medicine Hat,
Alberta, and Swift Current, Saskatchewan, are
located within Palliser's Triangle, which is better
described as experiencing subhumid or
semiarid rather than truly arid conditions.
Annual precipitation averages ten to fourteen
inches, to which winter snowfall contributes
two to three inches of water equivalent. This
results in a climatic designation of steppe
rather than desert or semidesert. Within the
triangle, as Hector himself reported, there are
localities with more humid environments.
These include the Cypress Hills, straddling the
Alberta-Saskatchewan border, receiving fifteen
to nineteen inches annual precipitation
and supporting a forest cover, especially on
north-facing slopes. In most of the region,
which occupies about 73,000 square miles,
shortgrass prairie is the natural vegetation.</p>

<p>The southeast corner of the triangle defined
by Hector lies in today's southwestern Manitoba,
but the true dry belt of the Canadian
Prairies extends only about as far east as 104
west on the forty-ninth parallel. Ranching,
dryland wheat cultivation, and oil and gas extraction
are the main industries, with some
specialized irrigation agriculture around Lethbridge.
Near Val Marie in southern Saskatchewan,
about 300 square miles have been included
in the Grasslands National Park Reserve.</p>
