<p>The white-tailed deer (<hi rend="italic">Odocoileus virginianus</hi>)
is one of two members of the deer family (Cervidae)
commonly found in the Great Plains.
When alarmed, white-tailed deer hold their
tails erect, baring their white underside and
white rump. Bucks (males) begin growing
bonelike antlers early each summer and by
early fall the antlers stop growing and harden.
The antlers have a main beam with tines erupting
from the top and are used for fighting and
establishing rank in the social hierarchy.</p>

<p>White-tailed deer are very adaptable, both
in the habitats they occupy and the foods they
eat. The highest densities of whitetails in the
Great Plains occur where forests along rivers
and streams are flanked by agricultural fields.
Wooded areas provide deer with protective
cover and natural foods. Agricultural fields
provide abundant, high-quality foods. The
availability of large tracts of winter cover and
travel corridors between seasonal ranges are
primary factors limiting populations.</p>

<p>By the early nineteenth century, unregulated
harvesting had extirpated white-tailed
deer from many areas. However, their ability
to adapt to human activities has allowed them
to revive throughout the region, and current
populations are stable to increasing in rural
and urban settings. In fact, their range may
be increasing westward. High deer populations
can create problems though, for farmers,
foresters, rural and urban residents, and
motorists. White-tailed deer are the most
popular big-game animal in North America.
Both deer hunting and habitat manipulation
are essential for managing and controlling
their populations.</p>
