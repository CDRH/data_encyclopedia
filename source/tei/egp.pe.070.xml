<p>Although grassland is the characteristic vegetation
of the Great Plains, contact with forests
and woodlands occurs at the boundaries
of the region, and significant areas of transition
between woodland and grassland vegetation
exist. Trees are also associated with
river systems and various physiographic features
within the Plains.</p>

<p>Tallgrass prairie is the dominant vegetation
of the eastern Great Plains. In Kansas and
Oklahoma a broad transition zone occurs
where the tallgrass prairie contacts the deciduous
forest of eastern North America, resulting
in a mosaic vegetation combining elements
of both plant communities. Where
prairie dominates and the tree canopy cover is
less than 50 percent, the vegetation is called
savanna. The trees most commonly associated
with savannas are various species of oaks. Bur
oak (<hi rend="italic">Quercus macrocarpa</hi>) dominates the savannas
of the northeastern Great Plains. Post
oak (<hi rend="italic">Quercus stellata</hi>) and blackjack oak
(<hi rend="italic">Quercus marilandica</hi>) are the primary tree
species in the savanna region, called the Cross
Timbers, of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.
The balance between tallgrass prairie vegetation
and woody plants in savannas was maintained
historically by fire. Trees and other
woody species increase in number in savannas
where fire is suppressed.</p>

<p>In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta,
where tallgrass and mixed prairie contact the
boreal forest of the north, a transition zone,
called the Parkland Belt, occurs. This is a region
of grasslands interspersed with groves of
trees. Bur oak is the most common tree in the
eastern portion of this zone and is replaced
by aspen (<hi rend="italic">Populus tremuloides</hi>) to the west.
Isolated, islandlike occurrences of aspen/bur
oak parklands occur to the south in North
Dakota.</p>

<p>In Montana, Douglas fir (<hi rend="italic">Pseudotsuga menziesii</hi>)
forest occurs on the plains east of the
Rockies in association with isolated mountains
such as the Highwood and Bearpaw. Disjunct
occurrences of ponderosa pine (<hi rend="italic">Pinus
ponderosa</hi>) occur as forest and savanna in association
with landforms such as the Pine
Ridge Escarpment in western Nebraska and
the badlands of western North Dakota.</p>

<p>The Black Hills of western South Dakota
and adjacent Wyoming are forested with a
unique assemblage of trees and other plants
dominated by Rocky Mountain species but
also including species from the deciduous forest
of eastern North America and the boreal
forest of Canada. A similar mixing of elements
from these three forest types occurs
in the Niobrara River valley of north-central
Nebraska.</p>

<p>In northeastern New Mexico and adjacent
parts of Colorado and Oklahoma, areas of
woodland dominated by pi&#241;on pine (<hi rend="italic">Pinus
edulis</hi>) and juniper (<hi rend="italic">Juniperus</hi> spp.) occur in
association with escarpments, canyons, and
other physiographic features of volcanic origin.
Juniper savanna often occurs where the
shortgrass prairie comes into contact with
these woodlands.</p>

<p>At the southern reaches of the Great Plains
in Texas the shortgrass prairie mingles with
mesquite trees (<hi rend="italic">Propsis glandulosa</hi>) to form
mesquite savanna. Where the Southern Plains
blends into the Texas Hill Country, a mosaic
of woodland and grassland occurs with oaks
and junipers being the important trees.</p>

<p>In addition to these transition areas at the
boundaries of the Great Plains, forest vegetation
penetrates the Plains along many river
systems. A thin band of eastern deciduous forest
dominated by oaks and hickories (<hi rend="italic">Carya</hi>
spp.) borders the Missouri River and its tributaries
in eastern Kansas and Nebraska. The
diversity of trees and other plant species diminishes
upstream. In Oklahoma Cross Timbers
savanna extends westward into the Plains
along the Cimarron and Canadian Rivers.</p>

<p>Woody vegetation associated specifically
with the floodplain zone of streams and rivers
is termed riparian forest. Riparian forests occurred
historically along much of the major
rivers like the Missouri, Platte, and Arkansas.
Cottonwood (<hi rend="italic">Populus deltoides</hi>) was the main
tree of these forests and often was the only tree
along the western reaches of these rivers. Isolated,
western occurrences of cottonwood were
sometimes given the name "Big Timbers."
Other frequently associated riparian trees include
willows (<hi rend="italic">Salix</hi> spp.), hackberry (<hi rend="italic">Celtis
occidentalis</hi>), boxelder (<hi rend="italic">Acer negundo</hi>), and
elm (<hi rend="italic">Ulmus</hi> spp.). The Osage orange tree
(<hi rend="italic">Maclura pomifera</hi>), widely planted for hedges
and windbreaks by pioneers and farmers, originally
occurred in riparian habitat along the
Red River in Oklahoma and Texas.</p>

<p>Occurrences of woodlands add significantly
to the biodiversity of the Plains, having more
associated species of birds, mammals, and other
animals than the adjacent grasslands. These
areas were also important to the Native peoples
of the Plains, providing firewood, lodge poles,
bow wood, and other aspects of their material
culture, as well as providing sheltered places for
camps.</p>
