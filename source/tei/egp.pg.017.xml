<head type="main">DIFFENBAKER, JOHN (1895-1979)</head>

<p>John George Diefenbaker, criminal lawyer,
politician, and Progressive Conservative prime
minister of Canada from 1957 to 1963, was born
at Neustadt, Ontario, on September 19, 1895.
Although Diefenbaker was born and died in
Ontario, his reputation will be linked forever
to the Canadian West and, in particular, to the
province of Saskatchewan. He was, as a colleague
once described him, "a prairie man to
the core." As such, his character was shaped by
his early life in Saskatchewan, his priorities
influenced by that region's attitudes toward the
issues he would face as prime minister, and his
policies directed toward making the country's
peripheries more important considerations in
national decision making.</p>

<p>Diefenbaker moved with his family to the
Fort Carlton region of the Northwest Territories
in 1903, when it was still a frontier. His
early years were spent in small Prairie communities
and, after 1910, in Saskatoon. After
attending the University of Saskatchewan and
serving in World War I, Diefenbaker obtained
a law degree and practiced law in Wakaw and
Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. In subsequent
years his legal career flourished, but he was
also drawn to politics.</p>

<p>Diefenbaker was nearly sixty-two when he
became prime minister, and the many defeats
he endured en route might have deterred a
man less convinced of his political destiny. He
stood for both Parliament and the Saskatchewan
Legislative Assembly twice, and he led the
Conservative Party in the provincial election
of 1938, in which not one of his candidates was
elected, before winning a federal seat in 1940.
He also contested the leadership of the national
Progressive Conservative Party twice
without success before winning it in 1956.</p>

<p>During his years in opposition, however,
Diefenbaker developed into a formidable debater
and platform performer, skills that served
him well in the 1957 and 1958 national election
campaigns. He led his party to a minority victory
in the first of these, but it was in the second
that his "vision" of a new and better Canada
captivated the electorate and brought the Conservatives
the greatest electoral triumph in Canadian
history to that time. His charisma and
oratory enthralled his audiences, and he offered
hope to a nation thirsting for innovative
ideas for strengthening the economy, especially
in the outlying regions of the country.</p>

<p>Once in power, Diefenbaker, with the able
assistance of a small group of advisers from
western Canada, attempted to set the country
on a new course after what they believed to
have been two decades of drift under the uninspired
leadership of the Liberal Party. These
men were motivated by Canadian nationalism,
a commitment to social justice, and a
conviction that government must create the
conditions whereby private enterprise could
develop all regions of the country. They believed
Canada to be a "treasure-house" of
wealth waiting to be tapped for the benefit of
all Canadians, and they were determined to
use these resources for both economic and social
goals. Under the auspices of the "New National
Policy," they emphasized natural resource
development to spur the economy,
create employment, and provide additional
revenues for much-needed social programs.
The Atlantic Provinces Power Development,
the South Saskatchewan River Dam, the Roads
to Resources that opened the north, and the
Resources for Tomorrow conference, which
catalogued Canada's potential, rank high on
the list of achievements of the Diefenbaker
government. So do its actions in aid of Canadian
agriculture, including the Agricultural
Rehabilitation and Development program and
the sale of grain surpluses to communist countries
such as China, which not only brought
prosperity to Prairie farm communities but
also created opportunities for Canadian businesses
which remain in place today. Other accomplishments
include legislation of Canada's
first Bill of Rights, extension of the franchise to
Aboriginal Canadians, and the adoption of
Diefenbaker's stand against apartheid by the
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Despite these successes, Diefenbaker's staggering
victory in 1958 created expectations that
probably no leader could have satisfied, and a
downturn in the economy of Central Canada
and unpopular decisions in the realms of defense
and foreign policy led to the defeat of his
government in 1963 and the loss of his party's
leadership four years later. Diefenbaker remained
in his beloved House of Commons
until his death in Ottawa on August 16, 1979,
but he never regained his former prominence.
Nevertheless, during his lengthy career, John
Diefenbaker accomplished much of merit. He
brought the concerns of western Canada to the
forefront of national politics. He rejuvenated
the Progressive Conservative Party in all regions
of the country. He brought to Canadians
a heightened awareness of their potential
greatness and the importance of "justice" as a
fundamental principle of their polity. Any deficiencies
he displayed while prime minister
do not outweigh these important contributions
to his country.</p>
