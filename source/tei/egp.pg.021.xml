<p>Dwight D. Eisenhower, the thirty-fourth president
of the United States, was born in Denison,
Texas, a town near the Texas-Oklahoma
border, on October 14, 1890. He was the third
of seven sons of David Jacob Eisenhower and
Ida Stover Eisenhower. In the spring of 1891
the family returned to the home of their ancestors
by moving due north to Abilene, Kansas,
where Eisenhower's father worked in a
creamery. Eisenhower graduated from Abilene
High School in 1909. Lacking financial
resources, Eisenhower went on in 1911 to the
U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where
tuition was free. Upon graduating from West
Point in 1915, Eisenhower was assigned to
training U.S. Army infantry troops at Fort
Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. While
stationed there, Eisenhower met, and in 1916
married, Mamie Geneva Doud, daughter of
a prosperous Denver, Colorado, family. Together
they had two children&#8211;Doud Dwight
Eisenhower, who died of scarlet fever in 1921 at
the age of three, and John Sheldon Doud Eisenhower,
born in 1922.</p>

<p>Having been turned down for overseas duty
several times, Eisenhower spent the World
War I years moving from one military post to
another. Luckily, while stationed in Camp
Meade, Col. George S. Patton moved next
door to Eisenhower and introduced him to
Brig. Gen. Fox Conner, thus moving Eisenhower
into the army's upper echelon. Eisenhower
served on Conner's staff in the Panama
Canal Zone, and Conner went on to support
Eisenhower's admission into the Command
and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas. Eisenhower graduated in 1926, first in
his class of top army officers. He then served
as aide to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the army
chief of staff, following him to the Philippines.
When World War II broke out, Eisenhower
was asked by Gen. George C. Marshall, who
had replaced MacArthur as army chief of staff,
to serve in the War Plans Division. Eisenhower
went on to become commander of U.S.
troops in Europe, head of the Allied invasions
of North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, and in February
1943 was promoted to the rank of four-star
general. Later that year, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt named Eisenhower supreme commander
of the Allied Expeditionary Force in
Europe, and it was in this capacity that Eisenhower
directed the largest seaborne invasion
in history&#8211;the invasion of Normandy in
northern France that came to be known as
D day.</p>

<p>After the war Eisenhower returned home a
five-star general and war hero. He replaced
Marshall as army chief of staff in 1945 and
directed demobilization efforts. In 1948 he retired
from active military service to become
president of Columbia University, and he
published his account of the war, <title level="m">Crusade in
Europe</title> (1948), which became an immediate
best-seller and made Eisenhower a wealthy
man. Quickly leaving behind his career as an
academic administrator, Eisenhower gladly
accepted President Harry Truman's invitation
to become supreme commander of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (<hi rend="smallcaps">NATO</hi>) forces in
early 1951.</p>

<p>Although both political parties tried to
draft him as their candidate, in 1952 Eisenhower
retired from the military after thirtyseven
years of service and ran as the Republican
nominee for president of the United
States. In June of that year he defeated, with
the help of a Texas delegation, the more conservative
Sen. Robert A. Taft of Ohio for
his party's nomination, accepted Richard M.
Nixon as his vice presidential running mate,
and later defeated Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson of
Illinois for the presidency.</p>

<p>As president, Eisenhower was known for
delegating power and forging a middle ground
on policies, thus guaranteeing that he would be
criticized by Republicans when he wasn't criticized
by Democrats. As the first Republican
president since Herbert Hoover, Eisenhower's
domestic program, labeled "modern Republicanism,"
was designed not to dismantle New
Deal programs but to hold them in check with
Eisenhower's own brand of fiscal probity. He
signed into law the Agricultural Act of 1956,
which continued the system of flexible price
supports, albeit at prices less than farmers
wanted, and the Agricultural Act of 1958,
which provided for a phased lowering of price
supports. He supported expansion of social
security coverage to millions of additional
workers, including farmers, legislation to raise
the minimum wage to $1 per hour while expanding
its coverage, and he created the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare.
And, although unsuccessful, he attempted to
expand medical insurance coverage to the
needy. While strongly supporting privatization,
Eisenhower also obtained passage of two
massive federal public works projects&#8211;the St.
Lawrence Seaway in 1954 and the Interstate
Highway System in 1956.</p>

<p>Although not an outspoken defender of
civil rights, Eisenhower did much to advance
racial integration. As army chief of staff and
later as president he worked to integrate the
army and the navy. He supported the Justice
Department in its amicus curiae brief written
in support of ending segregation in the
<title>Brown v. The Board of Education of Topeka</title>
case before the Supreme Court and, while refusing
to publicly support the Supreme Court
in its Brown decision, Eisenhower made good
his promise to enforce the law by using federal
troops to force school desegregation in Little
Rock, Arkansas, in 1957. Eisenhower signed
into law the Civil Rights Act of 1957&#8211;the first
major civil rights legislation to be passed since
the Civil Rights Act of 1875.</p>

<p>As a former war hero, Eisenhower could
speak boldly of "massive retaliation" while
working on the side of peace and conciliation.
Eisenhower visited Korea and concluded a
truce in July 1953, refused to commit U.S.
forces in Indochina, worked to relax tensions
with the Soviet Union, and did not intervene
militarily when uprisings occurred in East
Germany and Hungary. A stanch anticommunist,
Eisenhower did not support the tactics of
Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy but left it to others to
publicly rebuke McCarthy. Eisenhower's anticommunist
bent could be seen in his support
of covert activities by the Central Intelligence
Agency aimed at undermining the spread of
communism abroad. When the Soviet Union
successfully launched Sputnik I, the first manmade
satellite to orbit the Earth, Eisenhower
responded with another major federal initiative
providing funds to increase the study of
science in public schools.</p>

<p>Although his critics were numerous, Eisenhower
remained popular with the American
people and was reelected in 1956, despite his
suffering a heart attack in 1955. He was above
all a pragmatic president, preaching the gospel
of a balanced budget but accepting quite often
the reality of budget deficits, especially when
the economy was weak. He was the oldest person
to hold the office of president up to that
time, the first president born in the state of
Texas, and the first president to warn against
the hazards of the military-industrial complex.
Eisenhower left office in January 1961
and retired to a farm near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,
where he completed his memoirs.
Eisenhower died on March 28, 1969, in Washington
