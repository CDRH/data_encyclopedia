<head type="main">LOUGHEED, EDGAR PETER (b. 1928)</head>

<p>Edgar Peter Lougheed was born in Calgary on
July 26, 1928, he was the grandson of Sir James
Lougheed, one of the dominant legal, political,
and business figures in early Alberta history.
Lougheed earned a bachelor of arts and
bachelor of laws from the University of Alberta
and master of business administration
from Harvard University. Returning to Calgary
in 1954, he spent the next eleven years in a
successful combination of corporate and private
legal practice. In 1965 he turned to politics,
assuming the leadership of the moribund
Progressive Conservative Party. Lougheed
served as premier of Alberta from 1971 until
his retirement in 1985.</p>

<p>By the late 1960s postwar oil and gas wealth
had created a "new" Alberta. Appealing to this
Alberta with the simple slogan "Now," Lougheed
and the Progressive Conservatives swept
into power in 1971, ending Social Credit's dynasty.
While expenditures on traditional responsibilities
soared, his government focused
much of its attention on joint publicâ€“private
sector "megaprojects" such as the Athabaska
tar sands development. Another landmark initiative,
the Alberta Heritage Trust Fund, targeted
its oil-derived revenues for both the enrichment
of the province's social and cultural
fabric and the diversification of its boom-andbust
resource economy.</p>

<p>Disagreements with the federal government
over energy resource pricing and taxation
simmered throughout the 1970s as Alberta
boomed, finally boiling over in 1980 with the
National Energy Program (<hi rend="smallcaps">NEP</hi>). Lougheed
denounced the nep as an economic and constitutional
declaration of war on Alberta. Two
years later Alberta's economy and provincial
revenues had crashed, but Lougheed won a
third landslide reelection by blaming Ottawa
while deftly downplaying the role of sliding
world oil prices and his own administration's
excessively ambitious spending. Although initially
dismissed by most non-Albertans as a
"blue-eyed sheik" selfishly hoarding the province's
windfall resource wealth, his steadfast
opposition to both Quebec separatism and
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's centralizing
constitutional vision gradually won him
respect.</p>

<p>Lougheed's legacy was a period of remarkable
social and economic development that
gave Albertans an unprecedented sense of self-confidence
and in the process compelled other
Canadians to acknowledge Alberta's growing
importance in national affairs.</p>
