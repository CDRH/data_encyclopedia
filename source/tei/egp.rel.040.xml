<head type="main">PROVENCHER, JOSEPH-NORBERT (1787-1853)</head>

<p>Born on February 12, 1787, at Nicolet, Quebec,
Joseph-Norbert Provencher (baptized Joseph)
was ordained in 1811 and served as a curate
until he was sent to the Red River Settlement
(Manitoba) in 1818 to establish the Catholic
Church in the Canadian West. Described as
moral, humble, tenacious, and devout, Provencher
was consecrated titular bishop in 1822
and first bishop of the diocese of the Northwest,
founded in 1847 at St. Boniface (Manitoba).
He died there on June 7, 1853.</p>

<p>Bishop Provencher worked tirelessly as an
ecclesiastic administrator. He built churches
and schools to serve the newly arriving Irish,
Scottish, and French Canadian Catholic settlers.
He sent priests out to the Métis hunters
and traders to solemnize their mixed-race
marriages. He created "itinerant missions"
with priests who traveled with various Plains
Native peoples, attempting to convert them to
Christianity&#8211;an endeavor that was largely unsuccessful
during this period. Provencher even
sent missionaries as far afield as Lake Athabasca
and the Pacific Northwest to establish
the Catholic presence. He skillfully avoided
conflict with rival Protestant groups and received,
like them, an annual grant from the
Hudson's Bay Company to assist in his activities.
During his career, Provencher made numerous
trips to Quebec, and two to the United
States and Europe, to garner Catholic support
for mission development. In total, Bishop
Joseph-Norbert Provencher brought thirteen
secular priests from Quebec and during the
1840s persuaded both the Oblates of Mary Immaculate
and the Sisters of Charity of the
Hôpital Général at Montreal (commonly
known as the "Grey Nuns") to establish themselves
in the Canadian West.</p>
