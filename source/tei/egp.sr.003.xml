<p>The Plains states made important contributions
to professional baseball throughout the
course of the twentieth century. Among the
hundreds of Plains natives who have played in
baseball's major leagues are several players
who have been recognized for their achievements
as World Series champions, most valuable
players, and members of baseball's Hall
of Fame.</p>

<p>During the first half of the twentieth century,
several Plains natives had careers that
immortalized them in the history of America's
national pastime. Tris Speaker, the "Grey Eagle"
of Hubbard City, Texas, was regarded as
one of baseball's great outfielders while playing
for the Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians
in the 1910s and 1920s. Speaker's 3,514
lifetime hits rank fifth in major-league history,
and his 792 doubles and 309 triples rank him
first all-time in both categories. Joe Tinker&#8211;one-third
of the Chicago Cubs' famous "Tinker
to Evers to Chance" infield&#8211;hailed from
Muscotah, Kansas. Another Hall of Famer
from baseball's early years is Sam Crawford of
Wahoo, Nebraska.</p>

<p>Rogers Hornsby of Winters, Texas, starred
for several teams. With the St. Louis Cardinals,
Hornsby batted .424&#8211;the highest single-season
batting average in major-league history&#8211;in 1924. "Rajah" won six consecutive
batting titles between 1920 and 1925, and his
career average of .358 is second in baseball history
only to Ty Cobb. The Waner brothers,
Paul and Lloyd, grew up in Harrah, Oklahoma,
and starred in the outfield of the Pittsburgh
Pirates in the 1920s and 1930s. Another
Oklahoman, "Pepper" Martin of Temple,
turned in what is still regarded as the best
individual performance in a World Series in
1931, leading the St. Louis Cardinals to the
championship with a .500 batting average.</p>

<p>Two of the era's outstanding pitchers were
Grover Cleveland Alexander, a native of Elba,
Nebraska, and Walter Johnson, who was born
in Humboldt, Kansas. Alexander (who was
played by Ronald Reagan in the movie, <title>The
Winning Team</title>) starred for several teams and
may be best remembered for his heroics in the
1926 World Series for the Cardinals. Johnson,
who spent his career with the Washington
Senators, held the career strikeout record for
many years. Johnson's 417 lifetime victories
rank him second to Cy Young in major-league
baseball history, and Alexander ranks third
with 373. Fifth on the all-time victory list is
Warren Spahn, who has lived much of his adult
life on a ranch near Hartshorne, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>The Plains continued to contribute players
to the major leagues after World War II. Mickey
Mantle of Commerce, Oklahoma, starred for
the New York Yankees in the 1950s and 1960s.
Mantle ranks fifth on the all-time home run
list and is still regarded as one of baseball's
greatest sluggers and most popular players.
Among Mantle's Yankee teammates was fellow
Oklahoman Allie Reynolds. Reynolds was born
in Oklahoma City and starred at Oklahoma
State University, whose baseball stadium is now
named for him. In 1951 he became the first
pitcher to throw two no-hitters in a single season.
Bob Gibson of Omaha, Nebraska, was one
of baseball's dominant pitchers in the 1960s.
Gibson won seven World Series games with the
St. Louis Cardinals in 1964, 1967, and 1968 and
still holds the all-time record for most strikeouts
in a World Series game. Richie Ashburn
of Tilden, Nebraska, starred for the Philadelphia
Phillies in the 1950s and later spent many
years as the team's broadcaster before his death
in 1997.</p>

<p>Johnny Bench of Binger, Oklahoma, is often
regarded as the best catcher to play the game.
Bench was selected most valuable player in the
National League in 1970 and 1972 with the Cincinnati
Reds. Bench teamed with Joe Morgan,
who was born in Bonham, Texas, and was most
valuable player in 1975 and 1976, to lead the
"Big Red Machine" to consecutive championships.
Willie Stargell, most valuable player with
the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979, was born in
Earlsboro, Oklahoma. Stargell's American
League counterpart as most valuable player,
Don Baylor, was from Blanco, Texas. Baylor
went on to additional success as manager of the
Colorado Rockies in the 1990s. One of the top
stars of the 1990s was Joe Carter of Oklahoma
City. In 1993 Carter's ninth-inning home run
won the final game of the World Series for the
Toronto Blue Jays.</p>

<p>Although the Canadian portion of the
Plains has not produced many major-league
baseball players, pitcher Reggie Cleveland
of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and outfielder
Terry Puhl of Melbourne, Saskatchewan, had
notable careers in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
