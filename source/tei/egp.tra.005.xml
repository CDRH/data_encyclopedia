<head type="main">BOZEMAN TRAIL</head>

<p>The Bozeman Trail served as the most direct
route from Julesburg, Colorado, through the
Powder River Country to the gold fields of Montana
in the mid-1860s. Mapped and marked by
John M. Bozeman and John M. Jacobs, the road
veered northwest from the Oregon-California
Trail at Bridger's Ferry (Fort Fetterman after
1867) on the North Platte River in eastern Wyoming,
skirted the Big Horn Mountains to the
Yellowstone River valley, and crossed Bozeman
Pass to Virginia City, Montana.</p>

<p>Lakotas, enraged by this invasion of their
hunting grounds, attacked travelers along the
route. The U.S. army provided protection with
military escorts and by establishing Forts
Reno, Phil Kearny, and C. F. Smith in 1866.
Nevertheless, Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho
warriors continued warring against construction
parties and wagon trains. The Native
Americans experienced both dramatic victories
and demoralizing defeats. Following their
Sun Dance in the summer of 1867, the Lakotas
planned to destroy all the forts. Their advantage
disappeared when the army replaced their
muzzle-loaders with the more accurate, fastershooting
Springfield breech-loading rifles.
During two decisive conflicts in August 1867,
the Hayfield fight near Fort C. F. Smith and the
Wagon Box fight near Fort Phil Kearny, small
military detachments repelled overwhelming
numbers of Indian attackers. In 1868 Red
Cloud signed the Fort Laramie Treaty, agreeing
to settle his Lakotas on the Great Sioux Reservation.
In return, the United States abandoned
the Bozeman Trail.</p>
