<head type="main">HARRIMAN, EDWARD HENRY (1848-1909)</head>

<p>Edward Henry Harriman was born February
28, 1848, in Hempstead, Long Island. A product
of Jersey City schools and two years at
Trinity School in New York City, he turned to
a career on Wall Street but became increasingly
interested in railroading. By 1893, after
helping reorganize the Erie Railroad, he began
rehabilitating other railways.</p>

<p>In December 1897 Harriman joined the
board of the bankrupt Union Pacific. A year
later he became chairman of the board of directors
of the Union Pacific and in ten years
put the road in first-class shape. In 1900 Harriman
acquired the Southern Pacific but was
prevented from entering the northwestern
railroad complex by James J. Hill and by his
own participation in the Northern Securities
Company, which was found guilty of monopoly
by the Supreme Court in 1904. Harriman
sold his northwestern railroad interests at a
substantial profit, which he invested in various
railroad companies throughout the country.</p>

<p>This action led the Interstate Commerce
Commission to investigate Harriman during
1906 and 1907. The inquiry uncovered the
vastness of his ventures and his use of the
Union Pacific as a holding company for other
railroad corporate funds. The findings of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, together
with Harriman's interests in both railroads
and insurance, not to mention his seeming
disdain of public opinion, led Americans to
label him a robber baron. Few knew the magnitude
of his charitable activities.</p>

<p>Harriman married Mary W. Averell on September
10, 1879, and they had six children. He
died on September 9, 1909, at his home in
New York.</p>
