<head type="main">GALVANIZED YANKEES</head>

<p>Galvanized Yankees were Confederate prisoners
of war who took an oath of allegiance
and enlisted in the U.S. Army, garrisoning
western forts and protecting overland trails
from 1864 to 1866. During the Civil War, Native
American grievances erupted in increased
attacks upon emigrants traveling up the Missouri
River and along the overland trails. Unable
to fill depleting Union lines in the East
and the West, President Abraham Lincoln
quietly authorized enlistment of repentant
Confederate prisoners of war into service
in December 1863. The First U.S. Volunteers
enlisted from January through June 1864 at
Point Lookout, Maryland, where their peers
dubbed them "galvanized Yankees." Gen.
Ulysses Grant ordered the regiment to garrison
forts along the Minnesota-Dakota frontier.
Enduring bitter cold and debilitating diseases,
the First U.S. Volunteers built Fort Rice
on the upper Missouri. They fought the Sioux,
thwarted illegal Indian trade, aided overland
emigrants, and gathered intelligence.</p>

<p>Five other regiments entered federal service
in 1865 from prison pens in Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio, and Maryland. The Fourth U.S. Volunteers
replaced the First Regiment on the upper
Missouri, while the other 4,000 "galvanized
Yankees" marched west from Fort Leavenworth
to occupy forts and stations and protect
travelers along the Oregon, Santa Fe, and stage
trails. Overcoming great physical hardship,
these U.S. Volunteers fought Indian raiders,
repaired telegraph lines, and convoyed supply
trains and stagecoaches that crossed the Plains
between Montana and New Mexico through
November 1866.</p>
