<p>Nelson Appleton Miles ranks among the army's
most effective leaders in the Indian wars of the
late nineteenth century. Born at Westminster,
Massachusetts, on August 6, 1839, he joined the
Union army following the First Battle of Bull
Run. Though lacking in formal military training,
he proved an excellent combat leader. He
participated in all of the Army of the Potomac's
major campaigns except Gettysburg, suffered
three wounds, and emerged from the war a
brevet-major general. He supervised the imprisonment
of former Confederate president
Jefferson Davis at Fortress Monroe, Virginia,
from May 1864 to August 1865.</p>

<p>In September 1866 Miles became a full colonel
in the reorganized post–Civil War regular
army. In April 1869, following Reconstructionrelated
duty in North Carolina, he was transferred
with the Fifth Infantry Regiment to
Kansas. During the next decade Miles commanded
troops in a succession of campaigns
against Native Americans in the Great Plains&#8211;the
Red River War (1874–75), the Sioux War
(1876–77), and the Nez Perce campaign (1877).
He was promoted to brigadier general in 1881
and later helped to organize the capture of
Geronimo. After securing a second general's
star, he oversaw the Ghost Dance campaign of
1890–91.</p>

<p>In 1895 Miles was appointed commanding
general of the army. He led the invasion
of Spanish-occupied Puerto Rico during the
Spanish-American War but later lost credibility
by making sensational, though unsubstantiated,
charges that the War Department
had distributed "embalmed beef" to American
soldiers. He also opposed much-needed structural
reform within the army. Upon reaching
the mandatory retirement age of sixty-four,
Miles retired from active military duty and
later unsuccessfully campaigned for the 1904
Democratic presidential nomination. He died
in Washington dc of a heart attack while attending
the circus with his grandchildren on
May 16, 1925, and was buried at Arlington National
Cemetery. Egotistical and a shameless
self-promoter, Miles had nonetheless established
a superb combat record against the
Confederates, several groups of Native Americans,
and the Spanish.</p>
