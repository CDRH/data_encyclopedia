<p>Spanning America's emergence as a world
power, John Joseph Pershing's military career
began in the Great Plains as a junior cavalry
officer in 1886 and concluded as army chief
of staff in 1924. Born September 13, 1860, in
Laclede, Missouri, Pershing graduated from
the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in
1886. Following duty in South Dakota and in
the Southwest, he served as military science
professor at the University of Nebraska from
1891 to 1895, founding the drill team now
famed as the Pershing Rifles. He taught Willa
Cather and included Roscoe Pound and William
Jennings Bryan among his friends. He
married Frances Warren, daughter of Wyoming
senator Francis Warren, in 1905.</p>

<p>The Spanish-American and Philippine-American
Wars proved Pershing's first career
break, when he came to future president Theodore
Roosevelt's attention in Cuba and then
performed well in the Philippine Islands. Promoted
over 862 senior officers to brigadier
general in 1906, Pershing gained national
prominence in 1916 with command of the
punitive expedition against Mexican revolutionary
Pancho Villa. Meanwhile, on August
27, 1915, Pershing lost his wife and three of his
four children in a fire at their house at San
Francisco's Presidio.</p>

<p>Pershing moved onto the international stage
after President Woodrow Wilson selected him
to command the American Expeditionary
Force when the United States entered World
War I in April 1917. Despite its late entrance
into the war, the army played a vital role, assisting
in blunting Germany's offensives in March
and July of 1918, then successfully attacking the
Saint Mihiel salient and in the Meuse-Argonne
sector as the war ended.</p>

<p>Promoted to general of the armies on September 3, 1919, Pershing ended his career
in 1924 as chief of staã. He retired to chair
the American Battle Monuments Commission
and perform ceremonial duties. On September
2, 1946, he secretly married Michiline
Resco. Pershing died in Washington <hi rend="smallcaps">DC</hi> on
July 15, 1948.</p>
