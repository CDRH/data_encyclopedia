<p>In 1720 the Spanish governor of New Mexico,
Antonio Valverde y Cos&#237;o, under orders from
the viceroy in Mexico City, sent out an expedition
to investigate rumors of a French thrust
toward New Mexico. The force of forty-two
soldiers, sixty Pueblo Indian auxiliaries, and
three settlers was led by Lt. Gov. Don Pedro de
Villasur. Fray Juan Mínguez went as chaplain.
There was also a French interpreter, "Juan de
Archebeque" (Jean L'Archev&#234;que), a survivor
of the La Salle expedition that had landed on
the Texas coast in 1685.</p>

<p>Having left Santa Fe in mid-June 1720, the
Villasur expedition encamped in early August
on a large river that most authorities identify
as the Platte, not far from a sizable Pawnee
village. An exchange of messages with the
Pawnees proved unsatisfactory, and Villasur,
suspecting treachery, prepared to withdraw.
On the morning of August 14, while the Spaniards
were gathering their horses, they were
attacked with musket fire by the Pawnees and
Otoes. Taken by surprise, the Spanish camp
was thrown into confusion. Only thirteen of
the soldiers escaped. Villasur himself perished
along with forty-five others, including Mínguez
and L'Archev&#234;que. The Villasur catastrophe
severely weakened New Mexico's defenses,
for the province had lost a third of its fighting
force.</p>
