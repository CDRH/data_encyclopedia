<head type="main">WORLD WAR II</head>

<p>At the beginning of World War II, American
political leaders in the Great Plains went to
Washington to lobby for location of war industries
in the region. As early as December 1940,
Gov. John Moses of North Dakota and the
Greater North Dakota Association, a group of
businessmen, presented plans for the establishment
of industrial plants in their home
state. Again, in March 1942, a North Dakota
War Resources Committee went to the nation's
capitol in search of war contracts. They met
with little success. By 1945 North Dakota had
received only $9 million of such contracts, out
of a national total of $225 billion. This was less
than any other state.</p>

<p>Still, Plains states did make significant contributions
to the national war effort, especially
in the production of crops, cattle, and oil.
Plains states also profited from the expansion
of federal military installations, training centers,
and new airfields. Some urban areas fared
particularly well. For example, Wichita, Kansas,
became an important aircraft manufacturing
city. There, the Stearman Aircraft Company
received military orders for more than
7,000 trainers, and when the Boeing Aircraft
Corporation of Seattle expanded its production
of <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>-29s, it made Wichita, with its secure
interior location, a primary facility. Employment
at the Boeing plant rose from 2,500 in
1941 to 27,000 in 1945, and 1,644 <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>-29s were
produced, more than at any other plant. The
plant closed at the end of the war but was later
reopened.</p>

<p>Kansas also secured aircraft modification
centers. By the time a plane was off the production
lines, the demands of combat often
required substantial changes. In March 1942
the War Department pressured Boeing to
modify 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>-24 trainer planes for immediate
combat duty in the Pacific. Time was of the
essence in providing the craft with heavier
armaments. Company officials lined up the
planes on four Kansas airstrips freshly made
from farmland. Six thousand Boeing workers
labored night and day, braving blizzards, to
modify these planes to military specifications.</p>

<p>The war affected the Great Plains in Canada
more than in the United States. At the beginning
of the conflict, political leaders in Manitoba,
Alberta, and Saskatchewan complained
that they were being left out of the mobilization
program. The government in Ottawa addressed
these concerns after 1941. Winnipeg,
Manitoba, received orders for aircraft parts,
and the General Motors plant in Regina, Saskatchewan,
converted to manufacturing explosives.
Regina, along with Winnipeg and
Calgary, Alberta, was also a major site for the
British Commonwealth Air Training Plan,
which trained aviators and repaired and overhauled
aircraft engines. Calgary became an
important refining center, especially for highoctane
aviation gasoline. The Prairie Provinces
also became sites for German and Italian prisoner-of-war
camps. As in the U.S. Plains states,
the Prairie Provinces' population as a whole
did not increase, but urban populations did.
Winnipeg, Edmonton, and Calgary boomed,
as Canadians from rural areas and smaller
cities moved to centers of war production. Canadian farmers prospered as they had not done
for more than a decade, and mechanization
increased the efficiency of agriculture.</p>

<p>In both countries, therefore, the war accelerated
existing trends, such as the decline of
rural population and of the number of farms.
It encouraged the movement of younger men
and women into industrial or service occupations
in towns and cities within the Great
Plains and elsewhere. In both Canada and the
United States, the government programs paid
veterans to enroll in vocational programs and
universities. In sharp contrast to the Great Depression,
World War II invigorated the economy
of the Great Plains and provided considerable
opportunities for its residents.</p>
