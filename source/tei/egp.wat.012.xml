<head type="main">KETTLE LAKES</head>

<p>Kettle lakes are a landscape feature characteristic
of glacial terrain. When glaciers that
covered the Northern Great Plains melted, the
rock materials that were incorporated in and
on top of the glaciers remained on the land
surface. These materials commonly enclosed
blocks of glacial ice that took many years to
melt because they were insulated from solar
radiation by the surrounding rock materials.
When the buried ice blocks finally melted,
they left a depression in the landscape. If the
area was wet enough to have a high water
table, the depressions filled with water to form
kettle lakes. These lakes commonly are isolated
from one another with respect to surface
drainage. They accumulate water from precipitation,
overland runoff, and groundwater,
and they lose water to evaporation and seepage
to groundwater.</p>

<p>The region of the Great Plains most recently
covered by continental glaciers lies within the
southern parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and
Manitoba in Canada, and north and east of the
Missouri River in Montana, North Dakota,
and South Dakota in the United States. Kettle
lakes, commonly called prairie sloughs in Canada
and prairie potholes in the United States,
are a defining landscape feature in this region
because of their abundance. The great majority
of kettle lakes are very shallow (less than ten
feet deep), but a few are nearly as deep as the
thickness of the glacial deposits that surround
them (as much as 100 feet deep).</p>
