<p>The Platte River Whooping Crane Maintenance
Trust is a nonprofit organization dedicated
to conservation of migratory bird habitat
along Nebraska’s Platte River. The trust’s
mission is to protect and maintain the physical,
hydrological, and biological integrity of
the river as a life-support system for whooping
cranes, sandhill cranes, waterfowl, and
other migratory birds. The trust acquires land
and water rights, manages and protects habitat,
and conducts research on migratory birds.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, the Missouri Basin Power Project
proposed the Grayrocks Dam on the Laramie
River (a tributary of the North Platte) in
Wyoming. The state of Nebraska and the National
Wildlife Federation objected to Grayrocks,
claiming it would jeopardize irrigation
and wildlife habitat downstream in Nebraska.
In 1978 a court-approved settlement provided
for certain mitigation and enhancement measures,
including the creation of the trust.
These measures satisfied the requirements of
the Endangered Species Act and allowed construction
of Grayrocks to continue.</p>

<p>The trust was initially funded by a $7.5 million
payment from the project developers. Income
from the fund is used to finance land
and water rights acquisition, research, and
land management. Three trustees appointed
by each of the parties to the settlement agreement
administer the trust. Through fee title
and conservation easements, the trust protects
and manages approximately 10,000 acres.
These lands are in active farming and ranching
operations, where such activities are compatible
with management of migratory bird
habitat. The trust also continues to pay property
taxes. In addition to land management
activities, the trust has participated in legal
proceedings, including the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission’s relicensing of Nebraska’s
McConaughy Reservoir and a lawsuit
between Nebraska and Wyoming to ensure
long-term protection of river flows. A licensing
settlement was reached in 1998 with the
Nebraska Public Power District and the Central
Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation
District, in which water stored in an environmental
"account" can now be released specifically
for wildlife needs. <title>Nebraska v. Wyoming</title>,
a legal dispute over the allocation of Platte
River flow, was settled in 2001, with Wyoming
agreeing to further restrictions on its consumptive
water use.</p>
