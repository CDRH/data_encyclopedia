<head type="main">RAINMAKING</head>

<p>It is not surprising that European American
settlers in the Great Plains, dependent on agriculture
and plagued by drought, would develop
an interest in rainmaking. The earliest
attempts involved the concussion method,
which was premised on the theory that gunpowder
explosions triggered friction and generated
nuclei to produce rain. In 1890 Congress
appropriated funds to put this theory
into practice. The task was given to Gen. Robert
St. George Dyrenforth. Experimentation
began on the c Ranch in Andrews County,
Texas, in 1891 and continued at San Antonio,
Texas, in 1892. No rainfall occurred. General
Dyrenforth was dubbed "General Dryhenceforth,"
and the remaining funds appropriated
for rainmaking experiments reverted to the
Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p>The public did not give up on rainmaking.
Frank Melbourne of Australia, the "rain wizard"
who claimed to possess a "secret formulae"
to produce rain, launched a successful career
in Goodland, Kansas, in 1891. Although
Melbourne guarded his techniques, other
rainmaking companies soon claimed knowledge
of his method. By 1892, the Goodland
Artificial Rain Company and the Swisher Rain
Company competed for business in South Dakota,
Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas,
Colorado, Utah, and California. By 1893, five
rainmaking companies hailed from Kansas, all
claiming use of Melbourne's method. Even
then doubters were still in abundance across
the Great Plains. Not much had changed since
the early days of rainmaking: once while Melbourne
was working in the Nebraska Panhandle,
Old Jules Sandoz rode down to watch;
following the performance that produced
thunder, wind, and a few drops of rain complete
with double rainbow, Old Jules remarked
to his neighbors, "I'll keep catching skunks for
a living." Eventually, fraudulent practices disillusioned
farmers, and rainmaking companies
lost support.</p>

<p>By the end of the nineteenth century, interest
in irrigation had supplanted interest in
rainmaking in Kansas. Still, Americans' faith
in science and progress carried the rainmaker
into the twentieth century. The cereal manufacturer,
C. W. Post of Texas, maintained belief
in the concussion method. From 1911 to 1914,
Post executed "rain battles" near Post City,
Texas, detonating dynamite along the Caprock
Escarpment. Inspired by an occasional rain
fall, Post optimistically predicted that rainmaking
would one day replace irrigation.</p>

<p>By World War I, as public interest in traditional
methods of rainmaking waned, scientists
turned to airplanes and cloud seeding
with sand, dust, and dry ice. This method used
existing clouds, rather than the earlier attempts
to create clouds, and met with some
local success.</p>
