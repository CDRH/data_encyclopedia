<head type="main">TRANSMOUNTAIN WATER DIVISION</head>

<p>When settlers arrived in the Great Plains they
noticed that more water was available in the
mountains than on the adjacent flatlands, and
they developed transmountain water diversion
projects, as well as other schemes, to capture
mountain runoff in storage reservoirs for
use during dry periods. Today, much of the
water supply of the Great Plains region near
the mountains is based on stored mountain
water. Without this imported water, the region
could not support as many farms and
cities as it does.</p>

<p>A good example of transmountain water diversions
is the Coloradoâ€“Big Thompson Project.
In this project, water flows thirteen miles
through a tunnel under Rocky Mountain National
Park from the Colorado River headwaters
to the East Slope. The project diverts
230,000 acre-feet to serve some 2,428 farms
and communities on the East Slope. It involves
extensive facilities that include twelve reservoirs,
thirty-four miles of tunnel, ninety-five
miles of canals or conduits, six hydroelectric
plants, and three pumping stations. The project
was long in the making and embroiled in
political controversy. The preliminary survey
was made in 1884; northern Colorado had
organized for the "Grand Lake Project" by
1933; and it was completed in 1956. Water management
remains a controversial issue in the
region, and it is doubtful that more large
transmountain water diversion projects will
be built.</p>
