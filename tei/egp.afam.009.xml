<p>In recent years, military and African American
historians have discovered a common interest
in the black regiments that served in the
American West. The term "buffalo soldier, a
phrase originally employed by the Plains Indians
to denote a black cavalryman, colloquially
has come to describe all African Americans
who served in the frontier army during
the late nineteenth century. Impressed with
the record of black troops in the Civil War,
Congress in 1866 created six new regular army
regiments, two cavalry and four infantry, that
consisted entirely of African American men.
After an 1869 consolidation, four black regiments,
the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth
Infantries and the Ninth and Tenth Cavalries,
comprised nearly 10 percent of the western
army. Serving in racially segregated regiments,
always under the command of white officers,
black soldiers laid telegraph lines, protected
railroad crews, escorted military prisoners,
and performed numerous other tasks that
made settlement of the Plains possible.</p>

<p>Immediately following their arrival, black
soldiers experienced trouble with white civilians.
At Fort Hays, Kansas, for example, an
ongoing feud with local townspeople culminated
in the lynching of three black infantrymen
in January 1869. Discrimination and violence
plagued their service at places like Forts
Larned and Leavenworth in Kansas and Fort
Concho in Texas. Empowered by their roles
as U.S. soldiers, African American servicemen
often defied western communities' racial
mores by patronizing saloons, brothels, and
other "white" establishments, resulting in
armed conflict. The military's relationship
with civilian settlements generally had never
been peaceful, and the presence of armed
blacks only intensified the friction. As a result,
commanders took special pains to station
black companies in areas remote from white
populations. The Twenty-fourth Infantry, for
example, spent more than a decade stationed
in West Texas and on the Mexican border,
fighting Indian raiders and recalcitrant outlaw
gangs. Indian Territory became another
assignment for black regiments. There, troops
enforced government policy on reservations
and prevented encroachment from white
ranchers and farmers. Despite concentrations
in these areas, however, companies of buffalo
soldiers were stationed throughout the Plains
until the late 1880s. As agents of federal expansion,
African American recruits, many of
whom had only recently left slavery, were
often responsible for dispossessing Native
Americans and relocating them to reservations.
Evident contradictions in this situation
did not seem to deter them from performing
official duties.</p>

<p>Black troops did display considerable loyalty
toward each other. Their desertion rates
consistently were far below those of white
troops, and their high reenlistments allowed
them to benefit from the presence of many
seasoned veterans in their regiments. For all
the danger, prejudice, and sheer boredom that
characterized their service, black soldiers developed
strong bonds based on uniform and
race, which made the frontier army one of the
more attractive options available to African
American males in the late nineteenth century.</p>
