<p>Born in Joplin, Missouri, on February 1,
1902, Langston Hughes was raised primarily in
Lawrence, Kansas, by his part-Indian maternal
grandmother, who instilled in him a love
of stories and of his people, and who often
covered him at night with the bullet-torn
cape of her first husband, who died in John
Brown's raid at Harper's Ferry. A world traveler,
Hughes was a key figure in the Harlem
Renaissance of the 1920s&#8211;and one of the few
to continue to actively publish and lecture after
that movement ended&#8211;and is considered
a major modern American writer.</p>

<p>Versatile and prolific, Hughes forged and
maintained an international reputation for
nearly half a century. A poet, novelist, playwright,
essayist, short-story writer, autobiographer,
columnist, editor, translator, and author
of children's books, Hughes published
more than fifty volumes of prose and poetry
during his lifetime, beginning at age nineteen
with the often-anthologized poem "The Negro
Speaks of Rivers" (1921).</p>

<p>Distinguished by his innovative adaptations
of jazz and blues musical forms in his poetry&#8211;
and by his love for the common black folk who
are its subject&#8211;Hughes is also well known for
his fictional creation Jesse B. Semple, or Simple.
Through this endearing "everyman" figure,
Hughes explored seriously, yet with characteristic
humor, some of the most important
questions of his day.</p>

<p>Although sometimes criticized for his art,
which in his early years was denounced by
some critics for its portrayal of "unsophisticated"
lower-class black urban life, and later
for his politics, which are considered by many
to be naive, Hughes encouraged a number of
younger African American writers, including
Alice Walker, and continues to hold a prominent
place in American literature. He died in
New York City on May 22, 1967.</p>
