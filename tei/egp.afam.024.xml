<p>Noble M. Johnson, the first major African
American movie actor, was born in Colorado
Springs on April 18, 1881. His father was a successful
racehorse owner and trainer. Johnson
attended public schools in Colorado Springs
(Lon Chaney Sr. was a classmate) until the
age of fifteen, when he struck out across the
country, following the racing circuit, training
horses, and working as a cowboy. Back in Colorado
Springs in 1909, he filled in for an injured
actor, playing an Indian, in a Lubin Film
Manufacturing Company Western, and his career
path was set.</p>

<p>Johnson made several films for Lubin before
joining with several other African Americans
(including his brother George) to organize
the Lincoln Motion Picture Company in
1916. Noble was the company's original president
and acted in its first three films. But he
was also getting roles in Universal Studios's
serials and was pressured by that studio to
resign from Lincoln in 1918. From that point
on, Noble Johnson was a Hollywood actor.</p>

<p>Light-skinned and athletic, Johnson was
cast in a great variety of often-major roles. He
appeared in <title>Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</title>
(1921), <title>The Navigator</title> (1924), <title>Ben Hur</title> (1925),
<title>King Kong</title> (1933), and <title>She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</title>
(1949). In a business characterized by racial
discrimination, Johnson played Native
Americans, Latinos, Asians, and other "exotics"
but was never billed as African American
or identified with African American roles. He
died in 1957, and his memory has faded, despite
the success and longevity of his career.</p>
