<p>The distinguished journalist, editor, and author
Era Bell Thompson was born in Des
Moines, Iowa, on August 10, 1905. Her family
moved to Driscoll, North Dakota, in 1917, and
her "love affair" with the state began. She attended
the University of North Dakota for two
years and received her bachelor of arts degree
from Morningside College in Sioux City,
Iowa, in 1933. She later pursued graduate study
at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern
University. Following the publication
of her early autobiography <title level="m">American Daughter</title>
(1946), which she wrote while holding a
Newberry Library Fellowship, John H. Johnson
hired her in 1947 as associate editor of
<title level="j">Ebony</title>. She served as the co&#8211;managing editor
of this magazine from 1951 to 1964, at which
point she became the international editor of
Johnson Publishing Company, a position she
maintained until her death. In 1954 her book
<title level="m">Africa, Land of My Father</title> appeared, and in
1963 she co-edited <title level="m">White on Black</title>.</p>

<p>Thompson received honorary doctorate
degrees from Morningside College (1965) and
the University of North Dakota (1969). Her
numerous awards include the Bread Loaf
Writers Conference Fellowship (1949), National
Press Club Citation (1961), Iota Phi
Lambda Outstanding Woman of the Year
(1965), the Society of Midland Authors' Patron
Saints Award (1968 for <title level="m">American Daughter</title>),
and Theodore Roosevelt Roughrider
Award, North Dakota's highest honor (1976).
The Black Cultural Center at the University of
North Dakota was renamed for her in 1979.
Thompson died on December 30, 1986, and
was buried in her family's plot in Driscoll,
North Dakota.</p>
