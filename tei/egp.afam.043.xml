<p>Born in a poor part of a poor town on November
18, 1957, Julius Caesar Watts made
football his ticket out of Eufaula, Oklahoma.
The first stop was Norman and the University
of Oklahoma, where he led Sooner teams to
Orange Bowl championships in 1979 and 1980.
Six years in the Canadian Football League followed
before he returned to Norman and became
a Baptist youth minister. Previously a
Democrat, Watts switched to the <hi rend="smallcaps">GOP</hi> in 1989
and won election to Oklahoma's corporation
commission in 1990. In 1994 he announced his
candidacy for the Fourth District's open congressional
seat and won handily. J. C. Watts
and Connecticut's newly elected Gary Franks
thereby became the first black Republicans in
the U.S. House of Representatives since 1935.
Franks lost in 1996, leaving Watts the lone African
American Republican in Congress.</p>

<p>Nationally, his star rose quickly. After a
powerful address at the 1996 Republican National
Convention, Watts joined Bob Dole's
campaign and was the party's choice to answer
President Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union
address. Secure at home, he spent much of the
1998 campaign season speaking on behalf of
Republican candidates everywhere. All of this
prepared him to be a prime beneficiary of the
subsequent shake-up in the Republican leadership.
On November 18, 1998, Watts unseated
Ohio's John Boehner by a count of 121 to 93 to
become chairman of the House Republican
Conference. It was his forty-first birthday.
Not yet in a third term, in 2000 J. C. Watts
had become the fourth-ranking leader of the
House majority party. In January 2003 Watts
retired from Congress and accepted positions
on the board of directors of Dillard's and as
national chairman of <hi rend="smallcaps">GOPAC</hi>, a national education
organization for Republican state and
local candidates.</p>
