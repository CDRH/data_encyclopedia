<p>Wellington and Wilma Webb are Denverites
who began their public careers as community
activists in the 1960s. Wellington's service began
with his election from District 8 on the
city's northeast side to the Colorado House of
Representatives in 1972. Wilma's began with
her appointment to the House from the same
district in 1980, to which she was subsequently
elected following King Trimble's resignation
to run for the Denver city council. Since then
they have held local, state, and federal government
positions and have been active in
the Democratic Party. Indeed, Wilma has held
positions in the party up to and including
party secretary.</p>

<p>From 1977 to 1981 Wellington served as the
regional director of the U.S. Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare, and from
1981 to 1987 as the director of the Colorado
Department of Regulatory Agencies. In 1987
he was elected auditor of the city of Denver,
remaining in that post until 1991 when he was
elected mayor, an office for which he had first
campaigned in 1983. He was the first African
American mayor of Denver. He was reelected
twice and concluded his third and final term
in July 2003. Wilma was reelected fives times
as the state representative for District 8, resigning
after her husband's election as mayor.
Perhaps her most significant achievement was
Colorado's recognition and celebration in
1984 of a state holiday on Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday, after a ten-year struggle that she
spearheaded.</p>
