<p>Hardy Webster Campbell was the Great
Plains's greatest exponent of dry farming,
which he termed "scientific soil culture." According
to historian Walter P. Webb, Campbell
was to tillage what William Jennings
Bryan was to politics&#8211;its apostle.</p>

<p>Born in Montgomery Center, Vermont, on
July 21, 1850, Campbell homesteaded in the
James River valley, Dakota Territory, in 1879
and began observations that led to his codification
of the Campbell System of farming
without irrigation in semiarid regions. The
principles of his system were deep plowing in
the fall, subsurface packing with a packer he
designed, light seeding, thorough cultivation
before and after seeding, and summer fallowing,
with thorough tillage (which he called
"summer culture") during the fallow period.
Campbell believed his system would make
family farming feasible on the Plains.</p>

<p>Campbell publicized his methods through
journals, books and pamphlets, associations,
demonstrations, and lecturing. His bestknown
books were the four editions of his <title level="m">Soil Culture Manual</title> (first published in 1902).
Journals he started include <hi rend="italic">The Western Soil
Culture and Campbell's Scientific Farmer</hi>.
Campbell founded the Western Agricultural
Improvement Society in 1895. More important
was the Dry Farming Congress, founded in
Denver in 1907. It originated as his personal
promotional vehicle, but it grew beyond his
control, with agricultural scientists getting involved
and questioning his methods. He carried
on most of his demonstration farming
and technical lecturing for western railroads,
including the Northern Pacific, Burlington,
Soo Line, Elkhorn, Union Pacific, Santa Fe,
and Southern Pacific. He also lectured for the
Alberta Department of Agriculture in 1906–7.</p>

<p>Campbell lived his later years in obscurity
in California and died there in 1937. His death
certificate identified him only as a fireman for
the Southern Pacific.</p>
