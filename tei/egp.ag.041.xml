<head type="main">FLAX</head>

 <p>Flax (Linum usitatissimum), a native of Asia, is
the source plant for the production of linen,
linseed oil, edible flax, and coarse and fine
paper products. Among these products, the
most important has been linseed oil, long
used in the manufacture of paint, varnish, and
lacquers. Flax is also used to produce linoleum,
oilcloth, and printer's ink, although
its importance has waned with the advent of
more synthetic materials and increased use of
soy-based inks.</p>

<p>Flax has traditionally been planted as a fiber
crop, where the plants are tall (up to four
feet), and as an oilseed crop (linseed oil, edible
flax). Fiber flax was raised in the United States
from 1658, when it was first introduced in the
colonies, until about 1956. All flax fiber used
for paper production is now imported from
Canada.</p>

<p>The flax production area in North America
has shifted north since 1945. The 146,000 acres
of flax harvested in the United States in 1997 is
a drastic drop from the 6.2 million acres harvested
in nineteen states in 1943. The United
States currently ranks sixth in world flax production,
while neighboring Canada ranks
first. Flax is ideally suited to the cool spring
temperatures and moderate summer temperatures
found in the Northern Great Plains
of the United States and the Prairie Provinces
of Canada. In 1997, 1,946,000 bushels of flax
were harvested in North Dakota, South Dakota,
and Minnesota, while 35,928,571 bushels
were harvested in Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
and Alberta.</p>
