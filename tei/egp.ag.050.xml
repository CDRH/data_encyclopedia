<head type="main">MILLET</head>

<p>Millet is a generic term meaning "small seed."
Three types of millet are grown in North
America: proso millet (<hi rend="italic">Panicum mileacium</hi>),
foxtail millet (<hi rend="italic">Setaria italica</hi>), and pearl millet
(<hi rend="italic">Pennisetum americana</hi>). Proso millet is a
short season plant that does well in low rainfall
areas (fifteen to twenty inches annual precipitation).
The seed is shiny white or red
and is a large component of birdseed. It is
also used for livestock and poultry feed. Proso
millet is grown primarily in eastern Colorado,
western Nebraska, and North and South
Dakota.</p>

<p>Foxtail millet is grown in many parts of the
world for forage and grain. In the United
States, the forage is usually dried for hay
and the seed is used in finch food because it
is smaller than proso seed. Foxtail millet
is grown in the Central and Northern Great
Plains.</p>

<p>Pearl millet is grown and used for human
consumption in Africa and for both forage
and grain in the United States. Pearl millet
forage is very productive in the southeastern
United States. There has recently been interest
in the use of the seed of pearl millet as a livestock
feed because of newer hybrids that are
highly productive. The greatest use of pearl
millet for grain is in Nebraska and Kansas.</p>

<p>Because millet is grown by dryland farming
there is considerable variation from year to
year in production and yield per acre. For example,
in 2002, 450,222 acres were planted
to proso millet in Colorado, Nebraska, South
Dakota, and North Dakota, but because of
prevailing drought conditions only 220,000
acres were harvested. This yield was only 12
bushels per acre, compared to the 33 bushels
per acre yield of 2001.</p>
