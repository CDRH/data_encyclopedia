<head type="main">PRAIRIE FARM REHABILITATION ADMINISTRATION</head>

<p>The Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration
(<hi rend="smallcaps">PFRA</hi>) is a branch of the Canadian government's
Department of Agriculture and
Agri-Food. It was established in 1935 to secure
the rehabilitation of the drought and soildrifting
areas in the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, and Alberta and to develop
and promote within these areas systems of
farm practice, tree culture, water supply, land
utilization, and land settlement that would afford
better economic security to the agricultural
population.</p>

<p>Over the years, <hi rend="smallcaps">PFRA'S</hi> mandate evolved
along with the agricultural sector. It now
works in all agricultural regions of the three
Prairie Provinces and the Peace River region
of British Columbia, offering its services
through its headquarters in Regina, Saskatchewan,
and through a network of twenty-two
district and five regional offices, a shelterbelt
center, eighty-seven community pastures, and
two irrigation crop diversification centers.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">PFRA'S</hi> services for resource care (soil and
water) and rural development include technical
expertise on land and water resource
management, land-use planning, crop diversification,
irrigation development, environmental
analysis, shelterbelt and wildlife habitat
plantings, and water quality analysis. It
offers technical and financial assistance to develop
water supplies (dugouts, wells, dams,
and water pipelines) and improve or protect
the quality of surface and groundwater resources.
It delivers water from Canada-owned
and -operated reservoirs to irrigation projects
and numerous communities in southwestern
Saskatchewan. It provides tree and shrub
seedlings for farmyard, field, and wildlife habitat
plantings. And it oversees the management
and operation of eighty-seven community
pastures as well as the management of
federal-provincial agreements, programs, and
projects related to soil and water resource care
and rural growth.</p>
