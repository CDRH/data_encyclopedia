<head type="main">ARBORETUMS</head>

<p>The term <hi rend="italic">arboretum</hi>, a place where woody
(tree, shrub, and vine) plants are grown for scientific
study and/or educational purposes, is
often used interchangeably with <hi rend="italic">botanical garden</hi>.
A botanical garden may also include herbaceous
(nonwoody) plants and may have an
arboretum collection as part of its program.</p>

<p>In the Great Plains, arboretums and botanical
gardens are vital components in the residents'
quality of life; they have long taken
their cultivated plantings seriously. Arbor
Day, an annual tree-planting day now observed
throughout the United States and in
several other countries for the purpose of foresting,
reforesting, or beautifying, was first
advocated by Julius Sterling Morton of Nebraska.
In 1872 Nebraska was the first state to
recognize Arbor Day.</p>

<p>Arboretums and botanical gardens in the
Great Plains serve varied purposes: for ornamental
demonstration plantings suited to particular
climatic conditions; for plant hardiness
and variety improvement research; for environmental,
conservation, and plant science
studies; and for recreation and aesthetics.
They can be as urban as the Denver Botanical
Garden, as rural as the Dyck Arboretum of the
Plains in Hesston, Kansas, as nonnative as the
Nikka Yuko Garden in Lethbridge, Alberta.</p>

<p>Education is an important mission of all arboretums
and botanical gardens. The Morden
Arboretum in Manitoba, occupying about 60
acres of a 640-acre federal government research
farm started in 1915, evaluates and develops
hardy landscape plants and in turn
works closely with industry to disseminate information.
The Cheyenne Botanic Gardens in
Wyoming, started in 1976 and operated by the
city park system, serves the community as a
source of horticultural demonstration and education
in its 6,800-square-foot passive solar
greenhouse and outdoor gardens.</p>

<p>Nebraska and Oklahoma have distinctive
network systems of arboretum sites across
their states. The Nebraska Statewide Arboretum,
started in 1978, has forty-eight diverse
a.liated sites, including the University of Nebraska
Botanical Garden and Arboretum on
two Lincoln campuses, featuring hardy and
experimental plantings to enhance the teaching,
research, and public service mission of
the institution. The Nebraska Statewide Arboretum
is also involved in rare plant conservation
as an affiliate of the national Center for
Plant Conservation. The Oklahoma Botanical
Garden and Arboretum, started in 1991 by
Oklahoma State University at Stillwater, has
thirteen affiliate sites, including the Myriad
Botanical Gardens and Crystal Bridge in
downtown Oklahoma City.</p>

<p>Plant collections exist in nearly all areas of
the Great Plains. University campus sites include
McCrory Gardens/South Dakota Arboretum
at South Dakota State University in
Brookings, Patterson Garden at the University
of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, and Devonian
Botanic Garden at the University of Alberta in
Edmonton. Independent organizations operate
the historic International Peace Garden on
the border between North Dakota and Manitoba,
and Botanica, the Wichita Gardens in
Kansas. Province, city, and university interests
operate the 2,300-acre Wascana Centre in Regina,
Saskatchewan. The Fort Worth, Texas,
Botanical Garden, started in 1933 and operated
by the city park system, is the oldest of its
kind in the Southern Great Plains. Plant evaluation
trials are conducted at the North Dakota
State University Research Arboretum.</p>

<p>The trend in landscape design today is one
of developing a regional style. In the Great
Plains, this approach includes using more native
plants in a less formal design.</p>
