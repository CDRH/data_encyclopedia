<head type="main">DUBOIS WILLIAM (1879-1953)</head>

<p>William Robert Dubois was the most prolific
designer of public, commercial, and residential
buildings in Wyoming during the first half
of the twentieth century. His architectural
legacy is still evident throughout the Cowboy
State. Dubois also designed buildings in Nebraska,
Colorado, and South Dakota.</p>

<p>Born in Chicago on November 15, 1879, Dubois
received his formal training there and
subsequently worked for an architectural firm
in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He came to the
Great Plains in 1901 as the supervising architect
responsible for the construction of the
Carnegie Library in Cheyenne. Dubois decided
to remain in Cheyenne and establish an
architectural practice.</p>

<p>Although his clientele varied, he is best
known for his public buildings&#8211;federal, state,
county, and city. The architect's most memorable
Wyoming state government buildings
include the Supreme Court Building (1935–
36), the east and west wings of the state capitol
(1915–17), and several structures on the University
of Wyoming campus in Laramie, including
Hoyt Hall (1921), the Student Union,
and women's and men's residence halls (1927).
The state also selected Dubois to design numerous
institutional structures: the City-
County (1918) and Federal Office (1932) Buildings
in Cheyenne and the Albany County
Courthouse (1931.32) still function as governmental
structures.</p>

<p>Dubois's compositions reflect a keen awareness
of architectural trends. He was a proficient
designer who utilized architectural
styles from Romanesque Revival (Wyoming
State Penitentiary Guard Quarters/Powerplant)
to neoclassical (City-County Building,
Cheyenne) to Restrained Classicism (Albany
County Courthouse) to Moderne (Laramie
Municipal Building). Generally, his public
buildings are characterized by formalism and
symmetry and are rectilinear in form. While
his earliest designs illustrate a commitment
to neoclassicism, they also reflect familiarity
with popular commercial design. Although
the exterior of Cheyenne's Plains Hotel is a
straightforward symmetrical terra cotta clad
structure embellished by a heavy neoclassical
cornice typical for 1910, the hotel's interior decor
once revealed a remarkable interweaving
of western and Native American motifs. Dubois's
work also reveals a love of details and a
skill in embellishing his designs, as exemplified
by the Supreme Court Building's Art Deco.
embossed metal ornaments. Clearly, Dubois
chose designs that suited his clientele. They
were popular, affordable, and well built. Over
the years Dubois designed more than 100 residences,
twenty-seven schools, four Carnegie
Libraries, and six churches. He also designed
numerous fraternal, commercial, hotel, and
apartment buildings.</p>

<p>In addition to his flourishing architectural
practice, Dubois served in the Wyoming legislature
for ten years. In 1903 he was elected to
the Wyoming House of Representatives and
served three sequential terms; six years later he
was elected to the Wyoming Senate in 1909 for
two terms. His leadership skills extended to
the Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce and
other civic organizations. As an accomplished
organist, Dubois demonstrated his talents in
churches and fraternal organizations and assisted
religious institutions in purchasing
organs. William Dubois died on May 31, 1953.</p>
