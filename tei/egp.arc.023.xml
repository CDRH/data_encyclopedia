<head type="main">FOUCART, JOSEPH (1848–1917)</head>

<p>The remarkable visual character of the urban
streetscape of Guthrie, Oklahoma, was dominated
by the influence of the European architect
Joseph Foucart, who was born in Arlon,
Belgium, on November 14, 1848. Founded on
April 22, 1889, by a land run, Guthrie was a
designated town site within a parcel opened
for homesteading in the center of Indian Territory.
By nightfall the dusty prairie had been
transformed into a bustling town of more
than 10,000 people. The pace of development
in Guthrie was staggering: frame buildings
were under construction the next day; the first
masonry building was completed within a
month; in June an electric streetcar system
was franchised; and by the end of summer
both the electric power plant and the waterworks
were operating. Foucart practiced architecture
in this bustling environment from
1889 to 1907. The original town site is now
designated a National Historic District.</p>

<p>Foucart's buildings in the commercial district
of Guthrie reflect the writings of the
French architectural theorist Eug&#232;ne Violletle-
Duc, with an emphasis on structural determinism
and Gothic styling. The buildings
have load-bearing masonry walls that are penetrated
with arched openings, with the lintels
often accented by contrasting stone to signify
their structural importance. Pilasters and engaged
piers are expressed as vertical supports,
and in some cases cast-iron columns are used
in a completely undisguised manner. Foucart's
designs reveal a predilection toward the
Gothic. They are often asymmetrical, yet the
most telling Gothic element&#8211;the pointed
arch window&#8211;is missing completely. In its
place are rounded arches and keyhole-shaped
arches that evoke a Muslim feeling. The
domes on the turrets and oriels on some of his
buildings suggest a Russian influence. There is
also a suggestion of influence by the American
Romanesque Revival architect H. H. Richardson,
with the rough-cut stone walls and
arched windows that combine stone lintels
with voussoirs of contrasting color.</p>

<p>One of Foucart's most prominent early
buildings is the Grey Brothers Block. The
lower part of the facade is pierced by several
large arched openings with rough-cut lintels.
The rhythm of the second floor then changes
to a series of closely spaced double-hung windows,
each crowned with a panel of patterned
and corbeled brick. At the cornice is an elaborate
sheet-metal band composed of a smallscale
decorative motif and accented by large
pinnacles that extend both above and below
the band. The effect is one of a progression of
elements defined by different visual scales and
textures, ranging from large, rough elements
at the bottom to small, smooth elements at
the top.</p>

<p>Another important early building is the De-
Ford Building. Foucart created an asymmetrical
composition of tall, narrow-arched windows
and crowned it with a profusion of
sheet-metal ornament. The ornament, like the
pattern of the windows, is also asymmetrical,
with a pyramidal form poised over the stair
leading to the second floor as if to provide
a visual landmark signifying entry. In the
side facade of the building Foucart abruptly
changed the pattern, and the arched windows
at the second story are much wider, with several
smaller keyhole windows lighting the
lower floor.</p>

<p>The State Capital Publishing Company was
one of his most important commissions. Built
in 1902, it is remarkable for the simplicity and
subtlety of the wall surfaces, fenestration, and
details. The primary facades are unusually flat
and restrained. Because of the facade's austerity,
the open, three-dimensional tower is a
powerful sculptural counterpoint that draws
immediate attention to the corner of the
building.</p>

<p>During the last decade of the nineteenth
century and the first decade of the twentieth,
Foucart became the premier architect of
Oklahoma Territory. He received important
commissions outside of Guthrie, including
the library for Oklahoma A &amp; M College at
Stillwater. Foucart moved to Sapulpa, Oklahoma,
shortly after statehood (1907). Although
he continued to practice, his buildings
in Sapulpa do not have the vigor of his earlier
work.</p>
