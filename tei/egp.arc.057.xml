<head type="main">WRIGHT, FRANK LLOYD (1867-1959)</head>

<p>The work of America's most renowned architect,
Frank Lloyd Wright, spanned a period
from the late nineteenth century through
World War I, the Great Depression, and World
War II and did not end until his death in 1959.
Although Wright's primary focus was on domestic
buildings, his contributions to public
architecture were also significant. His work
was based on the principles of "organic architecture,"
which he defined as "profoundly interrelated,
one thing to another, consistent as a
whole." Wright was born in Richland Center,
Wisconsin, on June 6, 1867. He learned architecture
through apprenticeship in Madison,
Wisconsin, and, after 1887, in Chicago, especially
at the firm of Adler and Sullivan.</p>

<p>Wright's work first gained significant attention
in the early years of the twentieth century
with his development of the Prairie style in
Chicago, Illinois. Prairie style is characterized
by sweeping horizontal lines, broad eaves, and
low-pitched hip roofs. Wright continued to
develop the Prairie style until he reached its
zenith with the Robie House (1909) in Chicago.
The next two decades of Wright's work
revealed a stylistic shift into more regional
themes until the 1930s, when he started work
on his Usonian houses. Wright saw a need for
inexpensive housing for the average American,
and his Usonian work was a response to
that need. Still based on the principles of
organic architecture, the Usonian house is
characterized by a modular system of design
and construction, inexpensive materials, and
manufactured components.</p>

<p>Wright's work in the Great Plains closely
reflects the evolution of his work as a whole.
Only about half of the nineteen projects he
designed for the Great Plains were actually
carried through to construction. Of these, the
Sutton House (1905) in McCook, Nebraska,
was the first. The Sutton House is a fine example
of the evolving Prairie style and anchors
Wright's work in the Great Plains. The Sutton
House was followed by the Allen House (1915)
in Wichita, Kansas. Built for Henry J. Allen
and his family, its mature masonry work and
other details make it a significant example in
Wright's development of the Prairie style. The
Richard Lloyd Jones House (1929) in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, was a significant departure for
Wright in his domestic architecture. Built for
Wright's cousin, the house was based on the
themes Wright had used earlier in his California
houses. Although the design was altered
during construction, the Community Church
(1940) in Kansas City, Missouri, is attributed
to Wright. Two houses built in Kansas City,
the Sondern House (1939) and the Adler
House (1948), are good examples of Wright's
more evolved Usonian ideas.</p>

<p>Wright's most significant work in the Great
Plains, the Price Tower (1954) of Bartlesville,
Oklahoma, is a striking example of his mature
thinking and an embodiment of his ideals.
Standing nineteen stories above the rolling
hills of northeastern Oklahoma, it makes a
dramatic counterpoint to Wright's earlier domestic
work. The design for the tower was
actually first conceived for St. Mark's in the
Bouwerie project (1929) in New York. That
project was never realized, and Wright resurrected
the concept for the Price Tower twentyfive
years later.</p>

<p>The Juvenile Cultural Center (1957) in
Wichita, Kansas, is another of Wright's nonresidential
works. The Kinney House (1957) in
Amarillo, Texas, the final example of Wright's
work in the Great Plains, embodies his mature
ideas concerning the Usonian house and was
completed just two years before his death in
Phoenix on April 9, 1959.</p>
