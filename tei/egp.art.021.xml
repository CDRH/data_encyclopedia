<head type="main">FARNY, HENRY (1847-1916)</head>

<p>Henry Fran&#231;ois Farny was one of the first artists
to make a career painting Great Plains Indians.
Born at Ribeauvill&#233;, Alsace, on July 15,
1847, Farny emigrated with his family to the
United States in 1854. He traveled to Fort Yates
in Dakota Territory in 1881 and came into contact
with the Sioux, whom he sketched. From
that point the focus of his work became the
western landscape and Indians. His paintings
are rarely topographical but often recall the
upper Missouri and Platte River valleys, the
Wichita Mountains in Oklahoma, and the
Rockies. The paintings are almost always populated
with nostalgically situated Plains Indians
painted in exquisite and accurately
rendered&#8211;albeit occasionally out of context&#8211;
detail. It should not be forgotten that Farny
was trained in a European tradition that valued
imagination and creativity; his work
strove to create an effect of a past age rather
than historical documentation.</p>

<p>Although he traveled frequently, Farny
worked exclusively out of the studio and was
at his best when painting either the Sioux or
the Apaches in what he considered their traditional
territories. He exhibited widely in
the United States, France, and Germany. His
painting <title>Danger</title> (1888) won a bronze medal at
the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. He is
perhaps best known for the pathos of The
Song of the <title>Talking Wire</title> (1904), which portrays an uncomprehending Sioux with his ear
to a telegraph pole. Farny died in Cincinnati
on December 23, 1916.</p>
