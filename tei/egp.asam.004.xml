<head type="main">ASIAN EXCLUSION LEGISLATION</head>

<p>The treatment of Asian immigrants in the
nineteenth century by federal, state, and local
governments, as well as by the public at large,
represents a bitter underside to U.S. and Canadian
history. In response to the demand for
cheap labor, Chinese first immigrated to the
United States in significant numbers during
the middle of the nineteenth century. They
were instrumental in completing the transcontinental
railroad and contributed greatly
to the mining industry in the West.</p>

<p>It is well known that after the Civil War,
greater legal freedoms for African Americans
came with the abolition of slavery and
the implementation of the Reconstruction
amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Far less
known, however, is the Chinese misfortune
that mounted during this same period. In California,
the home of many Chinese immigrants,
partisan political concerns, along with
labor unionism, figured prominently in the
often-violent anti-Chinese movement. The
American West as a whole experienced over
150 anti-Chinese riots during the 1870s and
1880s. The most destructive Great Plains riot
broke out in Denver on October 31, 1881, leaving
one Chinese person dead and causing over
$50,000 in damage. Calgary experienced a
similar riot in 1892.</p>

<p>In the first comprehensive federal immigration
law, Congress in 1882 barred virtually all
Chinese immigration to the United States and
also excluded criminals, prostitutes, "lunatics,"
"idiots," and the poor. The courts upheld
this and future Chinese exclusion laws. In the
famous Chinese Exclusion Case (1889), the
U.S. Supreme Court concurred with Congress
that the presence of "foreigners of a different
race" who "will not assimilate with us" was
"dangerous to the peace and security" of the
United States. Canada also sought to restrict
Chinese immigration. Beginning in 1885 Chinese
immigrants were forced to pay an entry
fee, or "head tax," to enter the country. Because
the head tax did not completely eliminate
Chinese immigration, the fee was raised
in 1903 to $500; the following year the number
of Chinese immigrants fell from more than
4,700 to 8. Canada barred all Chinese immigration
on July 1, 1923, a day Canadian Chinese
refer to as "Humiliation Day." Discriminatory
Canadian legislation directed at the
Chinese was not repealed until 1947.</p>

<p>As a result of restrictive immigration legislation,
the Chinese population in the Great
Plains declined after 1890, while Japanese migration
to the region increased, especially to
Colorado and Nebraska in the United States
and to Alberta in Canada. Both nations, however,
soon extended the exclusion laws to effectively
bar immigration from Japan and persons
of Asian ancestry from <hi rend="italic">any</hi> nation. For
example, the Gentleman's Agreement between
the United States and Japan in 1907-8 severely
restricted immigration from Japan. A similar
agreement between Canada and Japan limited
the number of Japanese male immigrants to
400 annually; in 1928 Japanese immigration
was further reduced to 150 per year. The U.S.
Immigration Act of 1917 expanded Chinese
exclusion to prohibit immigration from the
"Asiatic barred zone," including the vast majority
of Asia. A 1924 law, best known for
creating the discriminatory national origins
quota system, excluded from admission noncitizens
"ineligible to citizenship," which directly
affected Asian immigrants who could
not naturalize and become citizens.</p>

<p>Other provisions of the immigration and
nationality laws reinforced the anti-Asian sentiment
reflected in the exclusion laws. For example,
the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted
the law allowing "white" immigrants and persons
of African ancestry (after the Civil War)
to naturalize as barring Asian immigrants
from naturalizing. In <title>Ozawa v. United States</title>
(1922), for example, the Court held that a Japanese
immigrant, as a nonwhite, could not
naturalize and thus could not become a citizen.
Consequently, before repeal of the whiteness
requirement for naturalization in 1952,
Asian immigrants could not vote or enjoy
other rights associated with U.S. citizenship.
In Canada the Chinese did not gain suffrage
until 1947. The children of Asian immigrants
born in the United States or Canada, however,
became citizens at birth.</p>

<p>Several states, particularly in the West with
its growing Japanese population in agriculture,
enacted "alien land laws" in the early
twentieth century that barred the ownership
of certain real property by immigrants "ineligible
to citizenship." Racial animus combined
with economic factors fueled passage of
the laws. Influenced by California's alien land
laws of 1913 and 1920, Texas, Nebraska, New
Mexico, and Kansas enacted similar laws during
the 1920s; only Colorado and the Dakotas
did not. Alien land laws did not disappear until
the 1950s in most western states.</p>

<p>Over the course of the twentieth century,
the U.S. Congress slowly relaxed the Asian exclusion
laws. During World War II, pressures
to end the prohibition on Chinese immigration
to the United States grew as it became
increasingly embarrassing for the government
to prohibit immigration from China, a valued
ally in the war effort. In response to foreign
policy concerns, Congress in 1943 allowed
China a minimum quota of 105 immigrant
visas per year.</p>

<p>Despite this meager liberalization of the
law, the Immigration and Nationality Act of
1952 carried forward the bulk of the national
origins quota system that drastically limited
immigration from Asia as well as from southern
and eastern European. Not until 1965, as
the civil rights movement forever transformed
the nation, did Congress repeal the last vestiges
of the Asian exclusion laws. Restrictions
on Chinese immigration to Canada were
completely removed by 1967. Since the 1960s
immigration to the United States and Canada
from Asia has increased dramatically, as has
the overall Asian American population of the
two countries.</p>
