<head type="main">DENVER CHINATOWN</head>

<p>Chinese laborers working on various railroads
that traversed the Great Plains made
Denver's Chinatown their favorite haunt. In
February 1870 the Colorado Territorial Legislature
passed a resolution encouraging Chinese
to immigrate to the area as a means of
meeting its chronic shortage of laborers, especially
in the agricultural sector. With the decline
of gold mining on the West Coast and
the completion of the transcontinental railroad,
many Chinese went to Colorado seeking
better economic opportunities.</p>

<p>By the fall of 1870 there was a small settlement
of forty-two Chinese men and women
formed along Wazee (a term that probably
meant "Chinese") Street in Denver. This constituted
the center of Denver's small Chinese
community. (Denver's Chinatown was
also known as "Hop Alley," a derogatory term
that referred to the presence of opium dens
that were entered from the alleyways.) During
the 1870s Denver, along with its Chinese community,
experienced an economic boom and
an increase in population when gold was discovered
in the Rocky Mountains. On the eve
of the anti-Chinese riot (October 31, 1880),
there were 238 Chinese in Denver (approximately
39 percent of all the Chinese in Colorado).
In 1890 the Denver Chinese community
reached its apex with 980 residents.</p>

<p>As was the case with Chinatowns throughout
the country, Denver's Chinese community
was a "bachelor society," consisting of predominantly
young men. Because of the small
number of women, the Chinese community
was unable to have a traditional family life and
to reproduce itself. Racism prevented the Chinese
from entering most occupations and
forced 80 percent of them to work washing
laundry by hand. The rest found other occupations,
mainly within the Chinese community.
As a result of the Chinese Exclusion Act of
1882 and the introduction of steam laundries,
the Chinese community began to decline. By
1940 there were only 110 Chinese left, and they
were forced to disperse when the city razed the
few buildings remaining in Denver Chinatown
as part of its urban renewal program.</p>
