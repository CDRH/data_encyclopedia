<head type="main">GRAND FORKS, NORTH DAKOTA</head>

<p>Located at the confluence of the Red River of
the North and the Red Lake River on the
North Dakota.Minnesota boundary, Grand
Forks is one of the most flood-prone communities
of North Dakota. Although a difficult
site, the city's general situation has been favorable
since the 1860s for development as
the major commercial center for northeastern
North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.</p>

<p>Trade and transportation have always been
important to Grand Forks. European fur traders
visited the area in 1734, but continuous
European American settlement only began
with the creation of a steamboat-refueling station
in the mid-1860s. The first town-site plat
was recorded in 1875, and the city was incorporated
in 1881. The St. Paul, Minneapolis,
and Manitoba Railway came in from the east
in 1880; the Northern Pacific Railroad entered
from the south in 1882. Regional wholesaling
functions became significant in the early 1890s
as the region's settlement increased by immigration,
notably of Norwegians. Between 1890
and 1910 Grand Forks tripled in population to
reach 12,478 people.</p>

<p>Population growth and economic prosperity
increased and fluctuated from the 1920s
through the 1950s with the region's wheat, potato,
and sugar beet–based economy. In 1956
Grand Forks Air Force Base opened, sparking
a boom in population and retailing during
the 1960s and 1970s. Concurrently, enrollment
growth was substantial at the University
of North Dakota, and medical services also
expanded, making Grand Forks a regional
health-care center. Population had reached
43,765 by 1980 and 49,425 by 1990.</p>

<p>The 1990s were a time of economic turbulence.
Drops in retail and holiday spending by
Canadians, formerly a major component of
the local economy, had adverse effects, as
did the personnel reduction from post.cold
war mission changes at the air force base.
Compounding economic uncertainty were
the farm crisis of the late 1990s and the population
decline of the Devils Lake Basin, a major
part of the city's trade hinterland. Then
came the flood of 1997, the community's most
devastating natural catastrophe to date. Damage
to the metropolitan area of Grand Forks
(which includes East Grand Forks, Minnesota)
amounted to almost $3.8 billion.</p>

<p>Although seriously damaged by the flood,
the city has bounced back remarkably in
terms of the built environment, thanks to
massive amounts of federal and private aid. A
long-range flood protection program is under
way that consists of expansion of dikes and
abandonment of the most flood-prone areas.
Rebuilding of the central business district has
been extensive, as has the increase in residential
areas within the southern and western
parts of the city. Currently, the city of Grand
Forks covers 17.38 square miles and is expected
to continue to grow in area, but it is struggling
to resume its population growth.</p>
