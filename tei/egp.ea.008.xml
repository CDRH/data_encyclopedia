<head type="main">DOUGLAS, THOMAS (EARL OF SELKIRK) (1771-1820)</head>

<p>Thomas Douglas, Fifth Earl of Selkirk, organized
the first European settlement colony in
the Northern Great Plains. He was born at St.
Mary's Isle, Scotland, on June 20, 1771, the
youngest son in a large family. In 1806 he was
elected to the House of Lords, but his main
interest lay in settlement schemes. In <title level="m">Observations on the Present State of the Highlands of Scotland</title> (1805) Selkirk proposed government-sponsored
emigration as a solution to poverty
and potential rebellion incited by "progressive"
land use. Unable to secure official support,
he pursued private projects in Upper
Canada. Selkirk intended to help Highlanders
who had been displaced by large-scale sheep
farming to preserve their language, cultural
identity, and allegiance to the crown by relocating
them within the British Empire. In
1811 Selkirk acquired Assiniboia from the Hudson's
Bay Company, a land grant for peasants
dispossessed of their homes during the Highland
clearances. Selkirk's grant encompassed
116,000 square miles of present-day Manitoba,
Ontario, Saskatchewan, North Dakota, and
Minnesota&#8211;an area five times the size of
Scotland.</p>

<p>Inspired by Sir Alexander McKenzie's glowing
description in <title level="m">Voyages from Montreal</title>
(1801), Selkirk focused his efforts on the rich
agricultural potential of the Red River Valley,
which fell within the chartered land of the
Hudson's Bay Company. Selkirk gained influence
in the company through marriage and
major stock purchase. With the company experiencing
financial difficulties, caused in part
by their rivalry with the North West Company,
Selkirk successfully argued in favor of
an agricultural settlement. The Red River Valley
offered abundant natural resources, was an
ideal staging ground for fur-rich western regions,
and settlement would interfere with the
North West Company's trade. Recruited in the
Highlands, settlers first arrived at the confluence
of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers
(present-day Winnipeg) via Hudson's Bay in
1812. Despite extreme hardship in an isolated,
harsh environment, and Selkirk's failure to
obtain military protection, the population of
the Red River Settlement grew to several hundred
by 1816. With aid from local Saulteaux
and Metis, settlers wintered at the buffalo
feeding grounds near the confluence of the
Red and Pembina Rivers, where they constructed
Fort Daer, the first European settlement
in present-day North Dakota.</p>

<p>In 1815 Selkirk arrived in North America to
attend to court proceedings in the escalating
dispute over jurisdiction between the
Hudson's Bay and North West Companies.
Before these issues could be resolved legally,
the trade feud became violent. In the Seven
Oaks Massacre on June 19, 1816, M&#233;tis (debatably
armed and encouraged by Nor'westers)
burned houses and crops, killing twenty-one
settlers and dispersing the colony. Selkirk
spent the summer of 1817 at Red River Settlement
negotiating a treaty with the Indians and
trying to secure the colonists' title to the land,
before returning to Montreal. That year colonists
returned, greatly encouraged by Selkirk's
visit to the Red River.</p>

<p>Having taken direct charge in the offensive
against the North West Company, Selkirk
overstepped his authority and became deeply
entangled in an exchange of charges and
countercharges that would absorb his intellectual
and financial resources for the brief remainder
of his life. Weakened by consumption,
he returned to England in 1818. He
traveled to France seeking better health but
died there in 1820. The following year the
trading companies merged. Although the colony
continued to face environmental hardships,
it slowly grew. In the late 1830s Selkirk's
Settlement began to thrive when an overland
route tied the settlement to the growing outpost
of St. Paul on the Mississippi River.</p>
