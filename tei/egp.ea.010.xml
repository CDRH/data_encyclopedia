<p>Overall, the Great Plains served as home for
small numbers of Finns in the United States,
although their communities played a relatively
greater role in Canada's total Finnish settlement
picture. About 300,000 Finns immigrated
to the United States between 1864 and
1914, with massive emigration beginning in
the 1890s. The Finnish population of the
American Great Plains peaked at some 3,000
individuals in 1910, or only slightly more than
2 percent of the nation's total population of
130,000 foreign-born Finns. A small trickle of
Finns began to make their way to Canada during
the nineteenth century, but the majority of
these 118,000 &#233;migr&#233;s arrived between 1900
and 1930 and during the 1950s. In 1921 over 16
percent (2,100 individuals) of Canada's total
foreign-born population of 12,155 Finns resided
in the Great Plains; by 1931 the number
of Plains Finns had grown slightly to 2,400,
but this figure represented only 8 percent of
Canada's foreign-born Finnish population of
30,355 people.</p>

<p>The first Great Plains Finnish settlement
emerged in 1878 at Poinsett (now Lake Norden)
in Hamlin County, South Dakota; most
of Poinsett's early Finnish population arrived
from the copper-mining towns of northern
Michigan. Four years later a Finnish land
agent who worked for the Chicago, Milwaukee,
and St. Paul Railroad recruited a number
of Finns to Frederick in Brown County,
South Dakota. Soon thereafter, Finnish settlements
also appeared in western South Dakota:
at Lead and nearby mining towns in Lawrence
County; at Snoma and Newell in Butte
County; and at Buffalo and Cave Hills in
Hardin County. By the mid-1880s Finns were
also moving to Dickey County, North Dakota,
located just north of Frederick, South Dakota.
Other Finns subsequently settled in the
North Dakota counties of Logan, Emmons,
Towner, Rolette, Burleigh, and Mountrail.
The Rolla-Rock Lake community in Rolette
and Towner Counties, initially settled in 1896,
soon evolved into North Dakota's largest Finnish
colony. Other Finns moved to Montana's
Cascade and Fergus Counties, while a small
number settled in scattered areas of Wyoming
and Colorado.</p>

<p>Canadian Finns established their initial
Great Plains enclave in 1887 at New Finland
(Uusi Suomi), located along the Qu'Appelle
River in southeastern Saskatchewan. After 1889
New Finland's population expanded when
agents of the Canadian Pacific Railway who
wished to attract Finns from Minnesota and
the Dakotas selected it as a colonization site.
Western Saskatchewan began to be homesteaded
in 1905 by Finns who settled in and
around the communities of Elbow, Rock Point,
and Outlook on the Coteau. Additional Finnish
settlements established at Dunblane and
Dinsmore after 1909 included several Finns
who had been politically radicalized by their
experiences on Minnesota's Mesabi Range. A
much smaller concentration of Saskatchewan
Finns was also found in Turtle Lake just northwest
of North Battleford. In Alberta a group of
visiting delegates from Finland chose the Red
Deer district in 1899 as a potential Finnish settlement
node; three years later the first immigrants
began to move to the Sylvan Lake–
Eckville area located just west of Red Deer.
Immigrants also moved to other scattered
places in Alberta, including Radway, Stettler,
Foremost, and the Three Hills–Trochu area.
For many years Winnipeg was the only large
Great Plains city with a noticeable Finnish
population.</p>

<p>Virtually all Finnish Great Plains communities
included one or more immigrant
churches, the vast majority Apostolic Lutheran,
Suomi Synod Lutheran, or National
Lutheran congregations. Finnish temperance
and socialist halls served as gathering places
for social and political events, provided libraries
for avid readers, and accommodated
discussion and drama groups, bands, and athletic
and gymnastic teams. Cooperative retail
stores and grain elevators provided immigrants
with a modicum of economic security.
One institution, the Knights of Kaleva, which
eventually spread to Finnish communities
throughout North America, was organized in
the Western Great Plains town of Belt, Montana,
in 1898. A sister society, the Ladies of
Kaleva, was also formed in Belt six years later.
Intended to improve the image of Finns in
America, the Knights and Ladies of Kaleva
employed rituals derived from the <hi rend="italic">Kalevala</hi>,
the national folk epic of Finland.</p>

<p>The majority of Finnish settlers who immigrated
to the American Great Plains arrived
before they had exposure to the radical movements
that dominated Finland and the Great
Lakes region during the early twentieth century.
In Canada, however, most Great Plains
communities were settled by immigrants who
arrived from Finland after 1900; several of
these enclaves&#8211;especially those on the Coteau&#8211;
were much more likely to include institutions
that expressed the views of a radicalized
population. Overall, it is obvious that
despite their relatively small numbers, the
Finns of the Great Plains reflected the general
Finnish settlement picture of North America.</p>
