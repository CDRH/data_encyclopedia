<p>Anti-Semitism and lack of economic opportunities
caused about 1.25 million Jews to leave
Europe for North America between 1880 and
1914. Jewish immigration to the Great Plains
during these years was either kin-based or
promoted by agencies such as the Hebrew Immigrant
Aid Society and the Industrial Removal
Office. Additional influxes followed
World War II, with smaller numbers arriving
from the Soviet Union after 1975 and from
Russia after 1989. Jewish settlement in the
Great Plains, with notable exceptions, has
been urban. Routes of access for most Jewish
immigrants were east to west across both Canada
and the United States, and for smaller
numbers, north from the port of Galveston,
Texas.</p>

<p>Early Jews on the Plains were peddlers serving
Native Americans and homesteaders.
Most Jews subsequently settled in small towns,
where they established retail dry goods stores,
clothing and grocery stores, wholesale houses,
and, along the rail lines, scrap metal operations.
They gradually gravitated to larger cities
with better Jewish communal infrastructures.
The minimum critical mass necessary to
maintain substantial Jewish communal organizations
appears to be about 1,000 Jews. Second
and third generations gravitated toward
law, teaching, and medicine, and later into the
corporate world.</p>

<p>Plains cities with significant Jewish populations
include Winnipeg, Manitoba; Calgary,
Alberta; Regina, Saskatchewan; Billings, Montana;
Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska; Wichita,
Kansas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Amarillo
and Fort Worth, Texas. Still, the Jewish
presence in the Great Plains has never been
more than 2 percent of the general population,
and it is much less than this in rural areas.
Ninety-six percent of Manitoba's Jews, for example,
live in Winnipeg.</p>

<p>As settlement increased, Jewish organizations
proliferated in Plains cities. These included
welfare organizations, houses of worship,
free loan societies, and, in the larger
cities, Jewish community centers. Local organizations
had regional, national, and international
connections. The Anti-Defamation
League, Workmen's Circle, and the World
Zionist Organization, women's groups like
Hadassah, National Council of Jewish Women,
and synagogue sisterhoods, and men's groups
like B'nai B'rith linked Plains Jews through
education, activism, and philanthropy to New
York, Palestine, and Israel. Reform Temples
were linked to Cincinnati; Conservative, Orthodox,
Reconstructionist, and Lubavitch
were linked to New York. To ameliorate isolation
Jewish youth and adults were encouraged
through these organizations to meet coreligionists
in Kansas City, Chicago, and New
York. Jews in smaller towns maintained contacts
with rabbis, synagogues, and family and
friends in the closest urban area.</p>

<p>Although rural Jewish populations were
never large, as part of the "back-to-the-land
movement" of the 1880s, Jews took up farming
on homesteads with start-up loans from agencies
such as Cincinnati's Hebrew Union Agricultural
Society, Chicago's Jewish Agriculturalists'
Aid Society of America, and the Jewish
Agricultural and Industrial Aid Society. In
Canada the government offered incentives, including
exemption from military service, to
attract Jewish homesteaders. New Jerusalem,
founded in 1882 in Saskatchewan, was one of
the earliest Plains Jewish settlements. In North
Dakota the first settlements were around
Painted Woods and Devils Lake. After 1900
Burleigh County in central North Dakota became
the focus of Jewish settlements. By 1910,
the peak year, North Dakota had 250 Jewish
homesteads with 1,200 individuals. Other
Plains settlements were at Touro, Leeser, Beersheba,
Lasker, Gilead, Montefiore, and Hebron
in Kansas, and at Cotopaxi, Colorado.
However, no more than 10 percent of the Jewish
families stayed on the farms for ten years;
at the most 2 percent passed ownership to a
second generation. Lack of money and experience
was a problem, and many sold their
homesteads when they received titles after the
five-year residency and used the money to set
up businesses in Plains towns, or else they left
the region altogether. Often only a Jewish
cemetery survives as a reminder of the Jewish
homesteading movement. More enduring and
successful were individual entrepreneurs like
southern Wyoming sheep farmer Isadore Bolten
and the Wolf family who ranched in Albion,
Nebraska, for more than seventy-five
years.</p>

<p>In the cities, Jews participated widely in
politics and intellectual life. Jewish politics in
Winnipeg had a radical cast. In American politics
Jews served as mayors, members of the
House of Representative and Senate, and justices
on state supreme courts. Tillie Olsen, one
of the most significant Jewish writers, lived
in Omaha, Nebraska, in the 1920s. In the latter
part of the twentieth century, centers
for Jewish studies were established in several
Plains universities, deriving much of their financial
support from prominent Jewish philanthropists.</p>
