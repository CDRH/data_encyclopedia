<head type="main">MAXIMILIAN, PRINCE OF WIED-NEUWIED (1782-1867)</head>

<p>Prince Maximilian Alexander Philipp of
Wied-Neuwied was a German explorer and
naturalist who traveled through the United
States in 1832–34. He became well known for
his studies of the Northern Plains Indians, especially
the Mandans and Hidatsas.</p>

<p>Prince Maximilian was born the eighth of
eleven children on September 23, 1782, in
the city of Neuwied, Germany. His parents
were Friedrich Carl Count of Wied-Neuwied
(1741–1809) and Louise Wilhelmine Countess
of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1747–1823).
The most influential people in Maximilian's
career were Johann Friedrich Blumenbach,
the Enlightenment's leading theorist on comparative
anthropology, and naturalist Alexander
von Humboldt, who became his mentor
and friend after they met in Paris in 1814.</p>

<p>Whenever Prince Maximilian was free of
military service in the Prussian army, he diligently
pursued his scientific studies. He
learned his skills as a naturalist mainly on his
own, but he also enrolled at the University of
Göttingen in 1811–12 to study under Blumenbach.
In 1815, encouraged by Humboldt, Maximilian led his first major expedition to Brazil,
where he studied the flora and fauna of the
Mata Atlantica and Indigenous peoples such
as the Botocudo, Pur&#237;, and Pataxo. Upon returning
to Germany in 1817, Maximilian devoted
himself to the analysis of his Brazilian
experience, which culminated in the two-volume
<title level="m">Journey to Brazil in the Years</title> 1815–17
(1820–21).</p>

<p>In the late 1820s Maximilian began preparations
for a second major expedition. Originally
he played with the idea of exploring Labrador
or the Kirgisian Steppe in Russia, but by
1830 he had decided to travel to North America.
One stated purpose of this journey was to
continue his investigation of the flora and
fauna of the Americas, but he also intended to
study the Indigenous cultures of North America
and compare them with those of southeastern
Brazil. In May of 1832 Maximilian, accompanied
by the Swiss painter Karl Bodmer,
left Europe for the United States, where they
arrived in early July. After a tour of eastern
cities they traveled west. Because of a serious
illness resembling cholera, Maximilian was
forced to stay the winter of 1832–33 in New
Harmony, Indiana, where he enjoyed the
company of fellow naturalists Thomas Say
and Charles Alexandre Lesueur.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1833 Maximilian finally arrived
in St. Louis, where he made arrangements
to travel up the Missouri with boats
belonging to the American Fur Company. After
short stops at Forts Pierre, Clark, and
Union, Maximilian arrived at Fort McKenzie,
the westernmost point of his expedition, in
August of 1833. Originally Maximilian wanted
to extend his studies farther upriver into
the Rocky Mountains, but the hostility of the
three Blackfeet tribes forced him to reconsider
this plan. After about five weeks of fieldwork
around Fort McKenzie, Maximilian returned
to Fort Clark to stay for the winter of 1833–34.
There he devoted his time to a thorough study
of the Mandans and Hidatsas and to a less
complete analysis of the nearby Arikaras.</p>

<p>In his travel accounts Maximilian routinely
described the physical appearance of the Indigenous
peoples he encountered, then concentrated
on recording their customs, languages,
and cultures, including one of the
most important ceremonies of the Mandans,
the Okipa. Maximilian's visit to the upper Missouri
came at a time when the fur trade was altering
the social, political, and cultural characteristics
of the Northern Plains tribes, and he
recorded many of these changes, even though
he was not always aware of their significance.
His travel writings also reinforced the Romantic
interest in the "noble savage," an invented
image that had fascinated intellectuals
throughout Europe since the late Renaissance.</p>

<p>In April of 1834 the Prince journeyed back
to the East Coast, then on to Europe in July. As
soon as he returned to Neuwied, Maximilian
began the synthesis of his expedition, which
culminated in the publication of the two-volume
<title level="m">Travels in the Interior of North America</title>
(1839–41). In the years following, and until a
few years before his death on February 3, 1867
in Neuwied, he continued to publish articles
on his North American experience. Maximilian's
legacy survives in the nomenclature
of Plains plants and animals (for example, the
sunflower <hi rend="italic">Helianthus maximilianii</hi> and the
Cretaceous saurian <hi rend="italic">Mosasaurus maximiliani</hi>).</p>
