<head type="main">SWEDES</head>

<p>Swedes settled the U.S. Great Plains and Canadian
Prairies as a part of their mass migration
to North America from the 1860s on, many
coming via settlements in Illinois, then the
cradle of Swedish America. They followed the
river valleys and railways, many enticed by
propaganda from the states, railroads, and
steamship companies, or by the individual
efforts of ethnic colonizers and churchmen.
Old established settlements in the eastern
Plains and Prairies gave birth to new colonies
farther to the west; in addition, many immigrants
settled directly from Sweden.</p>

<p>The Swedish-born population peaked in the
period 1890 to 1910, with most subsequent migration
flowing from farming communities to
urban areas such as Winnipeg, Fargo, Omaha,
and Kansas City. In 1930 the Swedish-born
population was most apparent in Nebraska (12
percent of the foreign-born), Kansas (10.5 percent),
South Dakota (10 percent), North Dakota
(8 percent), and Texas (4.1 percent). At
that time, the Swedes outnumbered all other
Scandinavian groups in Nebraska, Kansas,
Texas, and Oklahoma. Swedes operated mixed
grain, livestock, and wheat farms, worked as
contractors and builders, and quickly became
upwardly mobile in the professions, especially
the second generation. Swedes established
many ethnic institutions such as hospitals,
schools, clubs, and newspapers. Of those who
had a religious a.liation, most were Augustana
Lutheran, Mission Covenant, Methodist,
or Baptist. At present, Texas leads the
Plains states in the absolute number of persons
of Swedish heritage, though most Swedes in
Texas are outside the Plains, followed by Nebraska
and Kansas. Nebraska, North Dakota,
and South Dakota have the highest percentage
of Swedes compared to other ethnic groups.
Traditional ethnic festivals such as <hi rend="italic">Midsommar</hi>
and Santa Lucia are celebrated at various
places throughout the region.</p>

<p>Sven Magnus Swenson, leader of a contingent
from Nassjo, Sweden, established a colony
of Swedes on the fertile, waxy prairies of
eastern Texas in the 1860s. Blanketing Travis
and Williamson Counties, the Swenson settlement
today is the largest contiguous Swedish
settlement in Texas. Wheat farming, cattle
breeding, and cotton production were the
early pursuits. The old settlements of East
Texas generated offshoots elsewhere, and today
people of Swedish heritage are found in
most Texas counties. Their urban presence
is greatest in Austin, Houston, and Galveston.
Swedish Lutherans founded Trinity College
at Round Rock, and Swedish Methodists
founded Texas Wesleyan College at Austin.
Swedes in Oklahoma have been relatively few
in number, with the overwhelming share of
them in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.</p>

<p>Swedish settlers in Kansas mainly followed
the Kansas, Big Blue, and Republican River
valleys west. Today, persons of Swedish ancestry
are in nearly all Kansas counties, with
the greatest concentrations in McPherson, Saline,
Wyandotte, Shawnee, Osage, Republic,
and Riley Counties. Mariadahl, the oldest
Swedish enclave, was established in the Big
Blue Valley in the 1850s. The First Swedish
Colonization Company, founded in Chicago
in 1868, was instrumental in establishing the
Lindsborg Colony (Saline and McPherson
Counties), today the largest rural concentration
of Swedes in Kansas. The largest urban
concentrations are in Kansas City, Topeka,
and Salina, all important transit cities in
the early phases of Swedish migration. From
eastern Kansas and Lindsborg the Swedes dispersed
westward, establishing Swedesburg
and Walsby on the Republican River, as well
as a spattering of settlements elsewhere identified
by names like Stockholm. Bethany College,
founded in 1881 in Lindsborg, is one
of the Swedes' most notable and enduring
contributions.</p>

<p>Swedish Americans are found throughout
Nebraska, but the heaviest concentrations are
in the eastern urban centers of Omaha and
Lincoln. In 1930 more than 10 percent of
the population of Omaha was Swedish-born.
Large rural settlements coalesced at Wahoo,
Malmo, and Swedeburg in Saunders County,
just west of Omaha; Oakland in Burt County;
Polk, Swedehome, and Stromsburg in Polk
County; and Axtell and Holdrege in Kearney
and Phelps Counties, respectively. The Swedes
founded Lutheran College at Wahoo, Immanuel
Deaconess Institute in Omaha, Bethphage
Mission for tuberculosis patients at Axtell,
a children's home at Holdrege, and hospital
facilities sponsored by the Swedish Covenant
Church and Augustana Synod.</p>

<p>Swedish migration into the Dakotas was
primarily individual, not group, so extensive
colonies like those in Kansas and Nebraska
were never formed. Swedes followed
the Northern Pacific and Great Northern
Railroads and settled in farm and small-town
settings among the more numerous Norwegians.
Harwood, dating from 1870–71, is the
oldest Swedish settlement in North Dakota.
Swedes have a notable presence in Fargo,
Grand Forks, Minot, Bismarck, and Williston,
as well as in smaller places like Finley, Prosper,
Sheyenne, and Kenmore. In South Dakota the
Swedes are most numerous in Sioux Falls and
elsewhere in Minnehaha County. Swedes also
settled in considerable numbers in the Dalsburg
and Komstad districts in Clay County
near Vermillion; Alcester and Big Springs in
adjacent Union County; and in other eastern
districts.</p>

<p>Most Swedes migrated to the Canadian
Prairies via the northern United States. They
followed the tracks of the Canadian Pacific
and Canadian National Railways, mostly westward
from Winnipeg, and took up residence
alongside other Nordic migrants, especially
the Norwegians. They avoided the dry prairies,
settling the parklands of mixed grass-woodlands, and established themselves as
lumbermen and agriculturists in mostly
mixed farm and wheat operations. The Swedish
element gravitated toward the professions
in Prairie towns and cities. In 1930, 40 percent
of the Swedes in Manitoba lived in Winnipeg
and its suburbs, most of them employed as
industrial, craft, and railroad workers. Logan
Avenue emerged as the hub of the Swedish
enclave in Winnipeg. Sizable rural enclaves
emerged at Lac du Bonnet and Teulon–Norris
Lake near Winnipeg; Eriksdale, Lillesve, and
Erickson-Scandinavia north of Winnipeg; and
Stockholm and Percival in Saskatchewan. In
1930 Swedes constituted 0.8 percent of the
foreign-born population of the Canadian
Prairies. Their largest absolute numbers were
in Saskatchewan and Alberta. In recent years
Swedish Canadians, like other Canadians,
have been drawn to the oil industries in the
Calgary and Edmonton regions.</p>
