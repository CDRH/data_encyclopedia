<p>Beginning in the late nineteenth century,
first communities and then touring companies
presented a combination of public humanities
and entertainment programs that
were labeled Chautauquas. The term originates
from the educational seminars held first
in 1874 at a site near Chautauqua Lake in
southwestern New York State.</p>

<p>The Chautauquas that appeared in the
Great Plains borrowed the name but drew
greater inspiration from the public lyceums
that had spread from New England through
much of urban America before the Civil War.
Chautauqua organizers hoped to bring education
and intellectual stimulation to their
communities. Scholars, actors, speakers, and
exhibits dominated the typical program. The
Chautauquans presented plays, reenacted historic
speeches, and offered lectures on topics
of general interest. They shared the stage with
politicians as well, who used Chautauquas to
reach a wider public.</p>

<p>The first Chautauquas were held during the
summer months in the Great Plains after 1880
and came about through the work of local
community leaders. Often, many of the first
community organizers had become familiar
with the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle (<hi rend="smallcaps">CLSC</hi>). The <hi rend="smallcaps">CLSC</hi>, which began in 1878
and had more than 2.5 million members by
1900, was a study program designed to bring
educational opportunities and enlightenment
to individuals who lacked the chance to gain
an education through traditional avenues. At
first the community-based Chautauquas copied
the New York Chautauqua Institute. A
combination of professionals and locals provided
the talent. Community leaders organized
financial support. Larger communities
that could afford to hire more recognized per
formers and presenters such as Carry Nation
and William Jennings Bryan attracted
large crowds.</p>

<p>Attempts were made by different Chautauqua
groups across wider regions to coordinate
their organization, fund-raiding, and
scheduling of program content. Disagreements
between local promoters undermined
these efforts. Private companies that offered
packaged programs appeared after 1900. These
companies coordinated the performers and
the themes and then booked their Chautauquas
in strings of communities. The standard
Redpath Chautauqua, developed by the Redpath
Lyceum Bureau in 1904, was one of the
first to tour parts of the Great Plains. By 1919
community organizations typically relied on
one or more circuit Chautauqua companies to
provide programming.</p>

<p>The circuit Chautauquas provided a wider
variety of presentations. However, competition
from motion pictures and radio reduced
popular support for Chautauquas. Improved
transportation, in particular, the spread of automobiles,
made it easier for consumers to
seek out entertainment rather than wait for it
to appear as part of a touring program. While
a collection of communities maintained their
Chautauquas into the 1930s, the Great Depression
undermined what financial and popular
support remained.</p>

<p>A modern revival of the Chautauqua form,
with scholars representing historical characters,
began in North Dakota in 1974. In this
incarnation, Chautauquas serve as a public humanities
program. A consortium of humanities
councils sponsors a touring Chautauqua in
the Great Plains each summer. The content
and the characters presented, organized
around a central theme, change each year.</p>
