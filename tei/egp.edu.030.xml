<p>Stories of the pioneers who notched a home
out of the western wilderness are preserved
at the National Ranching Heritage Center
in Lubbock, Texas. This museum interprets
western heritage through the preservation of
more than thirty-five early ranch structures
from some of the country's most historic
ranches. Lifestyles, music, art, and craftsmanship
are demonstrated through special
programs, exhibits, and annual events that
promote education and interest in ranching
history and perpetuate time-honored ranching
customs.</p>

<p>The National Ranching Heritage Center
displays the evolution of ranch architecture
from the late 1700s through the early 1900s.
Each building (a bunkhouse, barns, dugouts,
windmills, rustic homes, a one-room schoolhouse,
a blacksmith shop, a steam engine,
a depot, a Spanish fortress blockhouse, the
Queen Anneâ€“style home of a wealthy rancher,
and more) is authentically restored and furnished
and reflects the geography of its original
location and the local materials available
for its construction.</p>

<p>Some 90,000 people from throughout the
nation and abroad visit the National Ranching
Heritage Center each year to tour the
fourteen-acre Proctor Park historical site and
view permanent displays and temporary exhibits.
Some 8,000 students from Texas and
New Mexico enhance their classroom study
each year with memorable history education
experiences gained through their visits. More
than 200 volunteers help to ensure that guests
enjoy their time at the Heritage Center.</p>

<p>The concept of a complex to preserve the
history of ranching was approved by the Texas
Tech University board of regents in the mid-
1960s. They saw the National Ranching Heritage
Center as a way of preserving significant
evidence of the history of ranching and development
of the West. The new facility opened
during formal ceremonies from July 2 to 4,
1976, attended by dignitaries from throughout
the world and highlighted by the arrival of the
Bicentennial Longhorn Trail Drive.</p>

<p>On June 1, 1998, Texas Tech separated the
National Ranching Heritage Center from the
university's museum to provide greater visibility
and identity for the facility. Special
events and programs were developed, including
a Ranch Dance series, new children's
membership organization and activities, and
Grand-Day, on which visiting children are accompanied
by a grandparent or older relative.
Recognition programs include the Boss of the
Plains Award, presented to an individual who
has contributed greatly to the success of the
museum, and the Golden Spur Award, which
is annually presented to one of the nation's
outstanding ranchers.</p>
