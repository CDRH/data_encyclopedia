<head type="main">NORTH DAKOTA INSTITUTE FOR REGIONAL STUDIES</head>

<p>Located in Fargo, the North Dakota Institute
for Regional Studies was founded at
North Dakota State University (<hi rend="smallcaps">NDSU</hi>) in 1950
to stimulate and coordinate scholarship, research,
and publications that foster understanding
of regional life in the Northern
Plains and Prairies and related regions of the
world. In keeping with the land-grant university
tradition, both knowledge and application
are encouraged by institute programs.</p>

<p>Collections, publications, outreach, and the
Center for Social Research are the major activities
supported by the institute. Institute research
collections and archives related to the
Plains experience are housed in the ndsu Library
under the curation of library staff. The
publications program, which includes monographs,
occasional papers, and hardcover
and paperback books related to Plains life,
is housed in the College of Arts, Humanities
and Social Sciences. Outreach activities include
radio and television production, public
programs, and oral history. The Center for
Social Research conducts ethnographic and
survey research in the rural and urban Plains.
The institute codirectors are the director of the
ndsu Library and the dean of the College
of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. The
institute houses a small publications endowment
and the Gunlogson Fund for Plains
research.</p>

<p>The North Dakota Institute for Regional
Studies is the oldest Plains studies center
in the United States and houses the only
university-based press in North Dakota. Recent
publications include <hi rend="italic">Aristocrat of the West</hi>
by Larry Wowoide (2000), <hi rend="italic">Unwanted Bread:
The Challenge of Farming and Ranching</hi> by
Sheldon Green and James Coomber (2000),
and <hi rend="italic">Dakota Circle: Excursions on the True
Plains</hi> by Tom Isern (2000).</p>
