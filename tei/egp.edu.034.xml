<p>Born on the Winnebago Reservation in northeastern
Nebraska on December 28, 1884, to
parents who still lived mainly by hunting and
trapping, Henry Roe Cloud went on to become,
in Commissioner of Indian Affairs
John Collier's words, the "most important living
Indian."</p>

<p>Henry Roe Cloud was originally called
<hi rend="italic">Wohnaxilayhungah</hi>, or Chief of the Place of
Fear. He was given the name Henry Cloud by a
reservation school administrator. Later, while
an undergraduate at Yale, he was adopted by
Dr. and Mrs. Walter C. Roe, and he joined
their name to his own. Cloud graduated from
Yale in 1910, the first Native American to do
so, and he added to his credentials a bachelor
of divinity degree from Auburn Theological
Seminary in 1913 and a master's in anthropology
from Yale the following year.</p>

<p>Though educated in American institutions
and convinced that Native Americans should
strive to succeed within American society, Roe
Cloud was also a Native American activist. As
an undergraduate at Yale, he campaigned successfully
for the return of Geronimo's Apaches
from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, to the Mescalero
Reservation in New Mexico. Also while an
undergraduate, he was instrumental in the
founding of the Society of American Indians,
which advocated higher education for Native
Americans. Roe Cloud's persistent hope was
that Native Americans could become selfsu.
cient through education. In 1915 Roe
Cloud founded and became president of the
Roe Indian Institute in Wichita, Kansas, the
first college preparatory school for Native
Americans in the United States. The school
operated until 1935, though in 1931 Roe Cloud
arranged for its takeover by the board of the
national missions of the Presbyterian Church
as his obligations and ambitions at the national
level of federal Indian affairs multiplied.
One of those ambitions, to become commissioner
of Indian Affairs, was never realized,
but he played a key role in the preparation of
the Meriam Report (1928), which starkly revealed
the failings of the federal Indian policy.
As a Progressive and New Dealer, he supported
Collier's reforms in the 1930s, including
the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.</p>

<p>In 1933 Collier appointed Roe Cloud head
of Haskell Institute (Kansas), the largest of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs's off-reservation
high schools. Cloud's two years at the school
were difficult as he fought to integrate Native
American traditions into the curriculum and
to broaden the existing focus on vocational
education. He was appointed supervisor of
Indian education in 1936 and superintendent
of the Umatilla Reservation in Oregon in 1939,
but again he was disappointed when he failed
to secure a position on the Indian Claims
Commission, and in these later years he felt
that he was shunted aside by the bureau.
Henry Roe Cloud died in Siletz, Oregon, on
February 9, 1950.</p>
