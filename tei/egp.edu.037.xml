<head type="main">STATE AND PROVINCIAL HISTORICAL SOCIETIES</head>

<p>"Here open to all is the history of this people."
This phrase, carved in stone at the entrance to
the Nebraska State Historical Society library/
archives building in Lincoln, emphasizes a key
characteristic of state and provincial historical
organizations in the Great Plains region of the
United States and Canada. In contrast to their
counterpart institutions in other parts of the
country, and especially in the East and South,
state and provincial historical organizations in
the Middle West and Great Plains developed
as publicly supported institutions or government
agencies open to all rather than private,
members-only organizations.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1854, only eight years after it
was first organized, the State Historical Society
of Wisconsin became the first statewide
historical organization to receive a regular
state appropriation. The Minnesota Historical
Society, established in 1849, eventually followed
the Wisconsin model, as did most state
historical organizations in the Great Plains region,
including Montana, founded in 1865,
Kansas (1875), Nebraska (1878), Oklahoma
(1893), South Dakota (1901), and North Dakota
(1905). In other Plains states organizational
structures may have differed, but the
established tradition of public support and
open public access remained.</p>

<p>Nearly all of these organizations began as
research libraries that published books and
journals and held scholarly meetings that
sometimes lasted several days. As time passed,
they grew and developed into large, multifaceted
agencies with statutory authority to
operate museums and historic sites, conduct
extensive archaeological investigations, hold
the state's public record archive, and offer a
wide variety of public educational programs
for people of all ages. During the second half
of the twentieth century these organizations
often were designated as the agency responsible
for administering the federal historic preservation
programs within that state. As a result,
many of the state historical societies in
the Middle West and Great Plains regions
rank among the largest historical organizations
in the United States. Annual budgets
measured in millions of dollars and staffs of
well over 100 employees are typical.</p>

<p>In Canada the provincial museums perform
many of the same functions as state historical
societies in the United States, but there
is usually more emphasis on the development
of large-scale museums and publication and
archaeological programs. Public archives, historic
sites, and historic preservation programs
are the responsibility of other units of the
provincial or federal Canadian government.
The tradition of open public access and strong
public financial support, however, is as consistent
in Canada as it is in the Great Plains region
of the United States.</p>

<p>These state and provincial historical organizations
have been preeminent in serving the
interests of their entire state or province
through the extensive programs and services
they provide for every segment of the population,
including academic scholars, genealogists,
local historians, and students. Of special
interest are the journals published by these
institutions. <hi rend="italic">Montana: The Magazine of Western
History, Kansas History: A Journal of the
Central Plains, Nebraska History, Chronicles of
Oklahoma, South Dakota History</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">North
Dakota History: A Journal of the Northern
Plains</hi> are among the more popular historical
publications available. The historical societies
truly are full-service institutions open to all,
usually at little or no cost because of the public
financial support they receive.</p>

<p>The physical location of many state or provincial
historical society buildings adjacent or
in close proximity to the state or provincial
capitol symbolically reflects the importance of
its heritage to that state or province. In several
instances, such as in Nebraska, these historical
organizations are also near the state's primary
institution of higher education. Throughout
the Great Plains region of the United States
and Canada these state and provincial historical
societies are large, complex, multifaceted
institutions that rank among the leading historical
organizations of both nations.</p>
