<p>In 1949, two years after the establishment of an
independent air force, Secretary of Defense
James Forrestal appointed a board of educators
to review the education of core armed
forces officers. The board, headed by Dwight
Eisenhower and Robert Stearns, both university
presidents, advised creating a separate
institution to meet the needs of the new air
service. Overtaken by events in Korea, the recommendation
languished until 1954, when
Congress authorized Secretary of the Air
Force Harold Talbott to select the United
States Air Force Academy (<hi rend="smallcaps">USAFA</hi>) site. After
exhaustive consideration of 580 possible locations
in 45 states, three&#8211;Colorado Springs,
Colorado; Alton, Illinois; and Lake Geneva,
Wisconsin&#8211;were submitted to Secretary Talbott
for final site selection. Colorado's enthusiastic
support influenced the outcome. In
July 1955 the first cadets entered temporary
quarters at Lowry Air Force Base in Denver
while permanent facilities were being
constructed.</p>

<p>The Cadet Wing moved to the <hi rend="smallcaps">USAFA</hi>
grounds in August 1958. The following spring
206 cadets graduated and were commissioned.
As cold war tensions increased following the
Cuban missile crisis, authorized wing strength
nearly doubled to 4,417 cadets. The first female
cadets graduated with the class of 1980.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">USAFA</hi> campus is nestled among 18,000
acres fronting the Rocky Mountain's Rampart
Range. Its most endearing landmark is
the Cadet Chapel, architect Walter Netsch Jr.'s
innovative design of glass, aluminum, and
steel. The chapel's seventeen spires dominate
the cadet quadrangle and inspire the institution's
"Commitment to Excellence." That
commitment, despite occasional scandal, has
resulted in more than thirty Rhodes scholars
and critical leadership for the youngest military
service.</p>
