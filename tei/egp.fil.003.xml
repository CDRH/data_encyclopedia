<p>Actor, director, screenwriter, and Hollywood
outcast, Roscoe Conklin Arbuckle was born in
a sod house on his parents' farm near Smith
Center, Kansas, on March 24, 1887. His father
never liked farming, and a decade later he uprooted
the family and moved to California.</p>

<p>Neither Roscoe's parents nor his siblings
were heavy, but Roscoe quickly grew into his
nickname (a nickname he hated), surpassing
200 pounds by the time he was twelve. Nevertheless,
"Fatty" was agile, and by the time he
was fifteen he was performing in vaudeville up
and down the West Coast as acrobat, singer,
and magician. His break came in 1908, when he
was hired as an extra by the Selig Polyscope
Company, and he began a slow transition from
vaudeville to motion pictures, appearing in
numerous one-reel comedies. In 1913 he joined
Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios and was soon
a star, acting alongside, among others, Charlie
Chaplin. After 1916 he wrote, directed, and
acted in innumerable films, launching the career
of his fellow Kansan, Buster Keaton, in one
of them (<title>The Butcher Boy</title>, 1917). Arbuckle's
popularity soared; so did his salary, to $7,500 a
week by 1920.</p>

<p>His fall was meteoric. On September 4, 1921,
at an alcohol-soaked party at a San Francisco
hotel, the aspiring actress Virginia Rappe went
into convulsions after allegedly being raped by
Arbuckle. Five days later she died, and Arbuckle
was charged with murder. He was eventually
acquitted, but his career was ruined. In
the following years he directed films under a
pseudonym and seemed to be on the verge of
making an acting comeback when, in the early
morning of June 29, 1933, in New York City, he
fell victim to a heart attack.</p>
