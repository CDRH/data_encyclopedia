<p>Wallace Beery, the burly actor who made his
name in films playing a lovable slob, was born
in Kansas City, Missouri, on April 1, 1885. He
started in show business in 1901 as an elephant
trainer, rising to become elephant manager at
Ringling Bros. by 1904. Beery played in roadshow
musicals and Kansas City theater until
1913, when he began acting in Essanay film
comedies. His career in the movies began in
drag, playing Sweedie, a Swedish maid.</p>

<p>In 1920s silent films Beery mixed rugged
parts such as that of the menacing Magua in
<title>The Last of the Mohicans</title> (1920) with comedies
before developing what became his characteristic
role&#8211;the scoundrel with a heart of
gold&#8211;in <title>Beggars of Life</title> (1928). The advent of
sound opened up new horizons for his acting,
and he made his best films and became a major
star in the 1930s. He was nominated for an
Oscar for his convict role in <title>The Big House</title>
(1930), and he shared (with Frederic March) a
best actor award for his performance with
child actor Jackie Cooper in <title>The Champ</title>
(1931). The role for which he is probably best
remembered, however, is pirate Long John Silver
in <title>Treasure Island</title> (1934).</p>

<p>Beery continued making at least one film a
year during the 1940s. His last (and 252nd) film
was <title>Big Jack</title>, which was released in 1949, the
year he died (on April 15) in Beverly Hills,
California. Beery was married to actress Gloria
Swanson from 1916 to 1918, and his brother
(Noah Sr.) and nephew (Noah Jr.) were also
actors.</p>
