<p>Gary Cooper, the son of English immigrants,
was born Frank James Cooper in Helena,
Montana, on May 7, 1901. His lawyer father,
Charles Cooper, in addition to owning a
ranch outside of Helena, served for a time as
a member of the Montana State Supreme
Court. Young Frank loved the western life;
hunting, fishing, riding, and the natural grace
we associate with his screen persona doubtless
relate to his being so at home in the outdoors.</p>

<p>After high school, Cooper, who aspired to
become a political cartoonist, bounced from
college to college until he found himself in Los
Angeles, where his lanky frame (he was nearly
six feet three inches tall), stunning good looks,
and horse-riding ability helped him to win
numerous roles in a series of B-Westerns. His
break as an actor came in 1926, when Cooper,
whose agent had changed his screen name to
Gary, was cast as one of the leads in Henry
King's silent film <title>The Winning of Barbara Worth</title>. But 1929 was his watershed year, with
his performance in Victor Fleming's adaptation
of Owen Wister's classic Western novel
<title>The Virginian</title>. This film marks the advent of
the distinctive Cooper hero, an identity from
which he rarely deviated during his thirty-sixyear
career.</p>

<p>The Gary Cooper hero is characterized by a
seemingly simple and naive, almost awkwardly
shy and soft-spoken persona, equally
appealing to both men and women, whose
authentic nature emerges only when his sense
of honor and his personal courage are challenged
by a significant moral crisis. In <title>The Virginian</title> the eponymous hero, now a ranch
foreman, is forced to preside over the hanging
of his cattle rustler best friend, Steve (Richard
Arlen). In slow close-up director Fleming
focuses on the agonized face of the Virginian
as Steve is hanged and captures brilliantly the
grief, suffering, and profound solitude of the
conscience-stricken Cooper hero, for whom
the virtuous life always exacts a heavy cost.</p>

<p>Although only a third of Gary Cooper's
films were Westerns, he is best identified as a
Western star, perhaps because in all his films
he is so closely associated with certain qualities
of the West that have been derived from
our indigenous historical, literary, and folkloric
traditions. Indeed, the Cooper hero may
have been the most unaffectedly natural, the
most enduringly appealing and admirable, of
the great masculine American character types.</p>

<p>In 1937, for example, Cooper made one of
his most popular Westerns, The Plainsman, a
Cecil B. De Mille adventure epic based very
loosely on the lives of Wild Bill Hickok (Cooper),
Calamity Jane (wonderfully played by Jean
Arthur), and Buffalo Bill (James Ellison). Despite
the film's historical inaccuracies and genial
superficiality, Cooper, in his heroic portrayal
of Indian fighter Bill Hickok, manages to
endow it with considerable gravity and good
sense. The viewer is ultimately startled by
Hickok's death at the hands of Jack McCall in
Deadwood, South Dakota, only because he
seems so completely in control of his own life.
And yet a fatal aura of fragile, wounded humanity
surrounds him even in this generally
winsome film, if only because Hickok's relationship
with Calamity Jane is marred by a
previous betrayal, and, like the Virginian, he
has lost another friend, Buffalo Bill, this time
to marriage.</p>

<p>The Cooper hero emerges more profoundly
in a far superior film, <title>The Westerner</title> (1940),
directed by William Wyler. There Cooper's
representative Western type (it is interesting
that, more than any other Western actor, he
could play types, like a "Virginian," a "Plainsman,"
a "westerner," or, much later, a "Man of
the West") subdues a deranged father-figure,
the fanatical Judge Roy Bean (Walter Brennan),
in such a way that we feel both the justice
of Bean's downfall and the terrible loss for
the westerner that that just downfall entails.</p>

<p>Gary Cooper gave his greatest performance
as Will Kane, the ravaged hero of the cold war
classic <title>High Noon</title> (1952), for which he won his
second Academy Award (the first was for <title>Sergeant York</title> [1940]). Betrayed and driven to the
brink of despair by his fellow citizens in the
ugly, dusty Plains town of Hadleyville, Will
Kane walks its lonely streets in his solitary
struggle against the evil Frank Miller gang.
Ultimately, he is forced to confront Miller by
himself, and he does so with Odyssean cleverness
and intelligence. Finally, at film's end, his
enemies vanquished, in one of the most bitterly
cynical moments in any Western, Kane
contemptuously hurls his marshal's tin star
into the dust of Hadleyville as he and his wife,
Amy (Grace Kelly), the only person who has
finally come to his aid, leave the town and ride
out onto the prairie.</p>

<p>Bertolt Brecht once remarked that Gary
Cooper was the world's greatest actor because
he was never guilty of acting. Cooper's natural
affability and goodness of spirit, mixed with a
complex moral seriousness, all helped to define
his iconic "Americanness" as he strove in
film after film to embody our national character
at its ideal best. He set a standard no American
star has ever matched. "Just make me the
hero," Cooper once remarked to a director before
he had even seen a script. The director
did make him the hero, and so, of course, did
we the audience throughout his exemplary career.
Gary Cooper died on May 13, 1961, in
Beverly Hills, California.</p>
