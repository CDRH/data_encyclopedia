<p>Photographers, explorers, naturalists, authors,
and entrepreneurs, Martin and Osa
Johnson captured and presented tens of thousands
of images in their twenty-one films,
eighteen books, hundreds of magazine articles,
and many vaudeville presentations across
America. How these natives of southeastern
Kansas&#8211;Martin was born in Rockford, Illinois,
on October 9, 1884, but grew up in Independence,
and Osa Leighty was born on
March 19, 1894, in nearby Chanute&#8211;came to
become celebrated world travelers is a fascinating
story.</p>

<p>The Kansas Plains might seem an unlikely
stimulus for risk taking, but in 1906 twentytwo-
year-old Martin left Independence to
travel the South Seas with Jack London. Upon
his return to Independence he presented a
travelogue of his adventures that attracted the
admiration of the equally adventurous sixteen-
year-old Osa. They eloped in 1910 and
began twenty-seven years of adventure and
exploration, documenting their trips to the
New Hebrides in the South Seas, Borneo, and
Kenya in theatrical feature films like Among
the <title>Cannibal Isles of the South Pacific</title> (1918),
<title>Simba</title> (1928), and <title>Congorilla</title> (1932). The
Johnsons' efforts on behalf of animal preservation,
night photography, aerial photography,
and camera safaris have influenced later
generations of naturalists and photographers.
It says a lot about the Johnsons that upon arriving
in Africa they planted Kansas sunflowers
on the mountain slopes. After Martin's
death in a plane crash near Salt Lake City
on January 12, 1937, Osa wrote the autobiographical
<title>I Married Adventure</title> in 1940. She
died in New York City on January 7, 1953. The
Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum in
Chanute, Kansas, houses the Johnsons' maps,
Native artifacts, personal memorabilia, and
dozens of films, which can be viewed in a
thirty-seat theater.</p>
