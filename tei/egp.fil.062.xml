<p>A film and television star from 1934 to 1969,
Robert Taylor achieved renown as one of the
most handsome leading men in Hollywood
and distinction as one of the most professional
actors of his time. Born Spangler Arlington
Brugh on August 5, 1911, in Filley, Nebraska,
he attended public school in nearby
Beatrice, where his father was an osteopath
and his mother was an intelligent but ailing
housewife. Nicknamed Arly as a youth, he
rode a pony, took private cello lessons in Lincoln,
participated in drama and music activities,
learned to dance, won a state oratorical
contest, and made the honor roll. In 1929
he attended Doane College and continued his
drama and music interests. For two summers
he also performed as part of a musical trio on
kmmj radio in Clay Center, Nebraska. Brugh
then followed his cello teacher to Pomona
College in Claremont, California, where he
graduated in 1933, and was discovered by a
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer talent scout.</p>

<p>During his career, the versatile Taylor appeared
in more than eighty motion picture
and television films and earned acclaim for his
romantic, swashbuckling adventure and Western
roles. The first American actor to appear
in a film made in England and the first major
Hollywood contract star to appear on television,
he also set the Hollywood record for
longest contract with one studio (twenty-four
years with <hi rend="smallcaps">MGM</hi>). As a matinee idol in the
1930s, he ranked as the decade's eighth top box
office attraction. He was the narrator of Academy
Award–winning feature-length documentaries
in 1944 and 1948 and the recipient
of a Golden Globe Award in 1954. Taylor also
starred in his own weekly television series, The
Detectives, from 1959 to 1962 and was host and
occasional star of Death Valley Days from 1966
to 1968.</p>

<p>Offscreen he flew an airplane, served in the
United States Navy from 1943 to 1946, disliked
Communists, liked steak, and wrote letters. An
avid outdoorsman, he rented a cabin near Buffalo,
Wyoming, fished on the Rogue River in
Oregon, and hunted in Nebraska, South Dakota,
and Manitoba. In 1954 he received the
first Outdoorsman of the Year Award presented
by the Winchester Repeating Arms
Company. A gentleman with the many ladies
he dated during his Nebraska and Hollywood
years, he had no major scandals, though he
had brief, discreet involvements with Lana
Turner and Ava Gardner during his first marriage,
from 1939 to 1951, to Barbara Stanwyck.
In 1954 he was remarried at Jackson Lake, Wyoming,
to German-born actress Ursula Schmidt
Thiess, a <title level="j">Life</title> cover girl who bore his son Terence
and daughter Tessa. Robert Taylor died of
lung cancer on June 8, 1969, in Santa Monica,
California. His close friend Ronald Reagan delivered
the eulogy.</p>

<p>Taylor was posthumously inducted in 1970
into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in
Oklahoma City, and reviews of the 1,000 best
movies in Magill's American Film Guide (1983)
included seven films in which he starred: <title>Magnificent Obsession</title> (1935), <title>Camille</title> (1937), <title>Three Comrades</title> (1938), <title>Waterloo Bridge</title> (1940),
<title>Johnny Eager</title> (1962), <title>Quo Vadis</title> (1951), and
<title>Ivanhoe</title> (1952). In 1988 Lorimar Telepictures
renamed the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Administration
Building after Taylor. In 1994 the Nebraska
State Highway Commission designated
the twelve-mile portion of U.S. Highway 136
between Filley and Beatrice as the Robert Taylor
Memorial Highway, and the Gage County
Historical Society established a permanent exhibit
on Taylor.</p>
