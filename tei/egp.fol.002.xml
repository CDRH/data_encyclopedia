<head type="main">ADAMS, RAMON (1889-1976)</head>

<p>Musician, businessman, bibliophile, and lexicographer,
Ramon Frederick Adams authored
twenty-four books about the West. Born to
Cooke M. and Charlie Adams in Moscow,
Texas, on October 3, 1889, he attended Sherman
Private School in 1903 and Austin College
in 1905. Adams dropped out in 1909 but returned
and graduated in 1912. He edited <title level="j">Reveille</title>,
a student publication, in 1907. Adams
studied violin under Carl Venth at Kidd-Key
College in Sherman and later taught at the
University of Arkansas until 1914. Further
study in Chicago before moving to North
Texas led him to chair the violin department
at Wichita Falls School of Music. Later he became
well known for accompanying silent
films in theaters in Wichita Falls, Fort Worth,
and Dallas. A wrist broken while he was trying
to crank a Model T Ford forced his retirement
from music. With his wife, Allie, whom he
had married while in Arkansas, Adams then
opened a highly successful candy business in
Dallas, first retail and later wholesale. They
sold the business in 1955, after which Adams,
who had privately published his first book,
<title level="m">Poems of the Canadian West</title>, in 1919 and sold
his first story to <title level="j">Western Story Magazine</title> in
1923, devoted himself to book collecting and
writing.</p>

<p>Adams's focus on cowboy life took him,
with support from various foundations, across
the Great Plains from Texas to Montana interviewing
and collecting. His books include <title level="m">Six Guns and Saddle Leather</title> (1954), an extensive
bibliography; Charles M. Russell, the <title level="m">Cowboy Artist: A Biography</title> (1948), written with Homer
E. Britzman; and <title level="m">A Fitting Death for Billy the Kid</title> (1960). Also important are the dictionary
<title level="m">Western Words</title> (1944); <title level="m">Come An' Get It</title> (1952),
which features western cooking; and <title level="m">The Cowboy and His Humor</title> (1968), which details the
entertainments of the old-time cowboy. <title level="m">Burrs under the Saddle</title> (1964) points out historically
inaccurate passages in Western writing, a passion
that drove Adams to extensive reading and
research.</p>

<p>Adams won the Dallas Public Library Award
in 1965 and received an honorary doctor of
letters degree from Austin College in 1968. He
died on April 29, 1976, in Dallas and was buried
there in Resthaven Memorial Park.</p>
