<head type="main">BARNARD, KATE (1875-1930)</head>

<p>Catherine Ann (Kate) Barnard is representative
of the women in the Great Plains who
made a career of social activism on behalf of
the poor and vulnerable, voicing the concerns
of the working class, minorities, women, and
families in agricultural states experiencing
rapid development. Kate was born in Geneva,
Nebraska, on May 23, 1875, but grew up in
Kirwin, Kansas. Her mother died there in
1877. In the mid-1890s she moved with her
father, John P. Barnard, to a claim he had
staked in the Oklahoma Land Run of 1889.
While her father practiced law in Oklahoma
City, Kate lived alone on the homestead, enduring
the isolation, wind, and hard work,
until the claim was secure. She then moved to
Oklahoma City and attended St. Joseph's
Academy. She taught in rural schools from
1896 to 1899 and then worked as a stenographer
before taking charge, in 1905, of the
Provident Association of Oklahoma City, a
floundering charity organization. Barnard's
highly successful appeals for contributions
through the <title level="j">Daily Oklahoman</title> newspaper
turned her home into a distribution center for
food, clothing, money, and job-placement information.</p>

<p>Barnard moved beyond charity to activism
when she founded the local chapter of the
Women's International Union Label League
and represented the workers of the Oklahoma
City Trades and Labor Assembly in 1905-7.
These efforts made her an attractive advocate
to socialist and populist political factions. She
developed alliances with women's groups such
as the Oklahoma Territory Federation of
Women's Clubs, and she traveled to several
major cities to interview the leaders of national
reform organizations, making valuable
contacts and gaining firsthand information
about the latest social justice measures. As
Oklahoma statehood approached in 1907,
Democratic Party leaders recognized Barnard's
political potential. She represented the
women's lobby at the preliminary Shawnee
Convention, urging child labor legislation,
compulsory education, prison reform, and
the creation of an office of commissioner of
charities and corrections to oversee these issues.
In the state document, members of the
constitutional convention worded the description
of the commissioner of charities and
corrections to include a woman officeholder
so that she might have the position. She was
such an effective campaigner that she polled
more votes from an all-male electorate than
any other candidate, including the governor.
She was reelected in 1910.</p>

<p>Barnard used her new office as the vehicle to
propose aggressive legislation to implement
her reforms and to demand adequate appropriations
to establish effective social welfare
institutions. Her graphic exposures in 1908
and 1909 of the treatment of Oklahoma prisoners
in Kansas jails led to the construction of
the first state penitentiary at McAlester and to a
national reputation as an authority on prison
reform. The publicity surrounding her descriptions
of the shortcomings of the Oklahoma
government's response to the poor and
helpless, as well as her outspoken demands for
money and action, soon angered party leaders
such as William "Alfalfa Bill" Murray, speaker
of the Oklahoma House of Representatives.
Barnard's prosecution of corrupt, court-appointed
"guardians" who dispossessed Indian
orphans of valuable land, money, and oil assets
led to her political downfall. In retaliation for
her interference, members of the state legislature
launched an investigation of her office, cut
her appropriations, and recommended that
the office be abolished. Barnard left political
office in 1914, exhausted and ill. In obscurity
she continued to advocate on behalf of society's
most vulnerable citizens until she died
alone in an Oklahoma City hotel on February
23, 1930.</p>
