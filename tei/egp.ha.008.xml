<head type="main">CHAVEZ, LINDA (b. 1947)</head>

<p>Linda Chavez is a prominent conservative intellectual
and activist. Her ideas on race and
ethnicity in public policy have made an important
contribution to the national debate.
Chavez is a leading critic of "identity politics"
&#8211;that is, the idea that racial and ethnic classifications
should play an important role in politics,
government, and law. Instead, she has
advocated assimilation and "color-blind" law.</p>

<p>Linda Chavez was born in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, on June 17, 1947. She grew up in
Denver, Colorado, and received her bachelor
of arts degree from the University of Colorado
in 1970. She married Christopher Gersten,
who became another important conservative
activist, in 1967. Chavez began her political
career as a Democrat but became unhappy
with the party because she believed it had
moved too far to the left. She served in the
Reagan administration, first as director of
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1983–
85) and then as director of public liaison in
the White House (1985). She then ran in 1986
for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, winning the
Republican nomination in a crowded field
but losing in the general election to Barbara
Mikulski.</p>

<p>Since then Chavez has mainly devoted her
career to writing and speaking on public policy
issues. She criticized liberal Hispanic organizations,
as well as programs like bilingual
education and affirmative action, in her 1991
book <title level="m">Out of the Barrio: Toward a New Politics of Hispanic Assimilation</title>. Chavez founded the
Center for Equal Opportunity in 1995 and
built the organization into a leading conservative
think tank. She writes a syndicated weekly
column, contributes articles to journals and
magazines, and frequently lectures and appears
on television and radio.</p>
