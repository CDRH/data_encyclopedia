<p>The <hi rend="italic">comancheros</hi> were an ethnically mixed
group of New Mexican merchants who in the
late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries developed
a distinctive form of trade with Comanches,
Kiowas, and other Plains Indians.
The comanchero trade began after 1786, when
the Comanches signed a treaty with Spanish
New Mexico and agreed to stop raiding in exchange
for trade and gifts. The treaty opened
the Southern Plains to New Mexico's traders,
who were eager to reactivate the lines of commerce
that had been broken during prolonged
Spanish-Comanche wars. Trade in the Plains
was officially sanctioned in 1789, when Governor
Fernando de la Concha allowed the Spanish,
Pueblos, and <hi rend="italic">gen&#237;zaros</hi> to take their goods
out to the grasslands. In their search for mobile
hunting bands, these traders sometimes
traveled as far north as the Platte River in
present-day Nebraska, but their main customers
were the numerous Comanche bands
of the Llano Estacado. The term <hi rend="italic">comancheros</hi>,
a derivation of their clientele's name, was first
mentioned in Spanish documents in 1813 and
was popularized in the 1840s by the Santa Fe
trader Josiah Gregg.</p>

<p>Each fall, after the harvest, the comancheros
loaded their burros and oxcarts (<hi rend="italic">carretas</hi>)
with beads, calico, tobacco, coffee,
sugar, kettles, and large butchering knives
(<hi rend="italic">belduques</hi>) and ventured onto the Llano Estacado.
A popular trade item was hard-baked
corn bread, which was highly desired by Comanches,
who needed carbohydrates to balance
their bison-based diet. In return, the comancheros
received horses, hides, dried meat,
tallow, and captives. During the first halfcentury
of the trade, the comancheros remained
relatively unorganized. They relied on
chance meetings with their clients, and the
volume of their business remained low. According
to Gregg, they seldom carried more
than $20 worth of goods to the Plains. During
the Spanish and Mexican periods, the comancheros also
suffered from vacillating official policies. At times, the comanchero trade
was seen as a means to obtain intelligence on
American actions in the Southern Plains, and
the officials granted licenses liberally. At other
times the officials prohibited the trade, which
they correctly thought stimulated Comanche
horse raids into Texas and Mexico. The U.S.
takeover of New Mexico resulted in stricter
licensing policies and other restrictions on the
comancheros, whose activities, particularly
the ransoming of captives, were abhorred by
the Americans.</p>

<p>The comancheros adjusted their commercial
strategies to the changing conditions. Beginning
in the 1850s they began to buy cattle
stolen from Texas ranches by Comanches. The
cattle found a ready market among wealthy
New Mexican merchants who had begun to
supply government beef contractors. Spurred
by the new traffic, the comanchero trade was
transformed from the unorganized, smallscale
operations of the early nineteenth century
into a mature commercial institution
with fixed marketplaces, an elaborate transportation
system, professional traders, and
varied merchandise.</p>

<p>The comanchero trade of the 1850s and
1860s revolved around designated rendezvous
sites, which featured irrigation ditches, adobe
shelters, and other structures, indicating at
least semipermanent occupation. The Llano
Estacado was dotted with sites such as Tecovas
Springs, northwest of present-day Amarillo,
Texas; Las Lenguas (or Los Lingos) Creek, the
modern-day Pease River; and Yellow House
Canyon or <hi rend="italic">Ca&#241;&#243;n del Rescate</hi> (Ransom Canyon),
near present-day Lubbock, Texas. Bartering
at these rendezvous could take weeks,
during which huge amounts of cattle and
commodities exchanged hands. Although the
trade in subsistence goods persisted, much of
the trade was now in firearms, ammunition,
whiskey, and other manufactured products. A
web of well-established cart roads and smaller
pack trails connected the rendezvous to each
other and to the Rio Grande Valley. Although
the comancheros' practices, by then almost
entirely associated with cattle-rustling, were
illegal under American law, the attempts to
repress them failed, mainly because many
army officers had secretly invested in the
trade.</p>

<p>The comanchero commerce reached its
peak during the Civil War. The relaxation of
frontier defenses in Texas allowed Comanche
raiders to steal Confederate stock and sell them
to comancheros, who in turn sold the animals
to Union agents. After the war, the comancheros
continued their lucrative operations
with Kwahada Comanches, who refused to settle
in the reservation that had been assigned to
them in 1867. Jos&#233; P. Tafoya and other prominent
comancheros amassed large profits, part
of which was invested in the sheep industry,
ranching, and freighting. But the ethnic, political,
and economic niche that had allowed the
comancheros to flourish was rapidly vanishing.
The bison herds were nearly gone, the
Kwahadas were forced into the reservation,
and the U.S. Army intensified its efforts to put
an end to the illicit trade. The final blow came
in 1874, when the army, guided by imprisoned
comancheros, destroyed the last Kwahada
strongholds on the Llano Estacado.</p>
