<head type="main"><hi rend="italic">ESCUELA TLATELOLCO</hi></head>

<p><hi rend="italic">Escuela Tlatelolco</hi> was founded during the
Chicano civil rights movement of the 1960s by
Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales, Chicano activist
and community leader, and it continues to
thrive as a private school in Denver, Colorado.
Named after the Indian city of Tlatelolco,
Mexico and rooted in Aztec history, Escuela
Tlatelolco is a community-based school that
transforms the pedagogy of oppression into
the pedagogy of hope. Its mission is "to liberate
the minds of students." Cultural expression
and leadership, with emphases on spirituality,
moral courage, honorable behavior,
and critical thinking, are the values and skills
that students are taught, providing them with
the means to act upon their world and create
social change and justice. Its success has been
with those "high risk" students who have
failed in traditional public school settings.</p>

<p>Using liberationist Paulo Friere's philosophy,
the school's teachers challenge students
"to seek out the root causes of oppression."
Escuela Tlatelolco's philosophy is based on the
understanding that "knowledge without action
has no value." It is believed that liberated
thinking provides students with avenues to
break the social, economic, cultural, and political
chains of oppression that keep them in
what has been termed "the colonial mentality."
Community service is expected, as students
engage in changing the social conditions
in the community.</p>

<p>Escuela Tlatelolco serves predominantly
Chicano and Mexicano youth in prekindergarten
through twelfth grade. The newly developed
<hi rend="italic">Circulo Montessori de Tlatelolco</hi>, a comprehensive,
community-based pre-Montessori
educational center, serves prekindergarten
through sixth grade, while the Academia Institute
serves middle-school-age youth. The
<hi rend="italic">Segundaria</hi> Program serves high-school-age
youth and runs on a year-round schedule.
Fully 90 percent of Escuela's students graduate
from high school.</p>
