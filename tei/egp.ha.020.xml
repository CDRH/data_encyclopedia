<head type="main">HISPANIC POPULATION GEOGRAPHY</head>

<p>Spanish was the first European language spoken
in the Great Plains. In 1540 Francisco V&#225;squez
de Coronado and 1,800 adventurers departed
from Tiguex, Nuevo Mexico, in search
of the fabled Seven Cities of Cíbola. Coronado
then traversed the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles,
the Arkansas River, and much of central
Kansas looking for Quivira, another fabled
realm of gold. Coronado returned emptyhanded,
but the Spanish legacy is evident in
Texas place-names such as Llano Estacado,
Tierra Blanca, and Palo Duro.</p>

<p>Permanent European settlement of the
grasslands began over 300 years later in New
Mexico and Colorado. Hispano homesteaders
&#8211;descendants of Spaniards who settled New
Mexico in 1598&#8211;migrated from the New Mexican
mountains to the High Plains east of Las
Vegas, New Mexico, as early as 1823. However,
widespread settlement of the Great Plains did
not occur until after 1848 when the United
States annexed northern Mexico. After 1848
Hispanos established several towns on the
New Mexican High Plains, including San Miguel,
Sabinoso, and Picacho, and several southern
Colorado communities, including Trinidad,
Trinchera, and La Plaza de los Leones
(Walsenburg). By 1900 approximately 2,000
Hispanos tended sheep and grew vegetables
between the Arkansas and Hondo Rivers, an
area that was part of the "Hispano homeland."</p>

<p>Hispano migration away from the homeland
began after 1900 when European American
farmers began irrigating the valleys of the
Arkansas and South and North Platte Rivers.
European Americans planted sugar beets
along the Platte and vegetables along the Arkansas.
Increased agricultural production led
to labor shortages, and many Hispanos migrated
from the homeland to take advantage of
the relatively high wages; some migrated as far
north as the Red River Valley in North Dakota.
Hispano barrios established in the 1920s are
still visible around sugar beet factories from
Loveland, Colorado, to Scottsbluff, Nebraska.</p>

<p>European American farmers in Texas used
water from the Ogallala Aquifer to irrigate
thousands of dryland acres on the Llano Estacado
and then recruited Tejano laborers
from the Rio Grande Valley to work the farms.
European Americans also financed railroads
to connect Great Plains states, but much of the
labor came from Mexico. By 1912 railroad
companies were encouraging Mexican families
to settle permanently on railroad property
near the tracks. By 1930 Mexican railroad
workers had established several barrios "on
the other side of the tracks" in towns in Oklahoma,
Kansas, Texas, and Nebraska. Between
1900 and 1930 what we now call "Latinos"&#8211;
Hispanos from New Mexico, Tejanos from
South Texas, and Mexicans from Mexico&#8211;laid
track and irrigation pipe and harvested crops
from Wyoming to Texas. The Great Depression
temporarily halted Latino migration to
the Great Plains.</p>

<p>World War II created labor shortages that
led in 1942 to Public Law 45 that authorized
Mexican workers, braceros, to enter the United
States as contract workers. Such contracting
continued through the 1940s and was formalized
by Public Law 78 in 1951. The Bracero
Program recruited Mexican laborers to work
in the United States at a guaranteed wage and
provided transportation, food, and housing.
The Bracero Program institutionalized the
Hispanization of certain sectors of the Great
Plains economy, especially the Llano Estacado
cotton farms. By 1950, 30,000 braceros and
Tejanos migrated annually to the Llano Estacado
to pick cotton and vegetables. Labor
shortages continued after the war because
many veterans took advantage of the so-called
<hi rend="smallcaps">GI</hi> Bill to get an education and leave farmwork.</p>

<p>Although the Bracero Program was abolished
in 1964, Great Plains farmers still relied
on Mexican labor. In 1965 the U.S. government
amended its longstanding immigration
quota policy in order to allow an increasing
number of Mexican migrants into the country.
After 1965 Hispanics began to diversify
from agricultural and railroad work and were
increasingly employed in factory jobs associated
with agribusiness such as beef processing,
well-drilling, and pipe-laying. Iowa Beef Processors
(<hi rend="smallcaps">IBP</hi>) and Monfort (now Con-Agra),
among others, needed to replace their diminishing
European American workforce and increasingly
hired Hispanic laborers in their
plants in Omaha, Grand Island, Lexington,
and North Platte, Nebraska; Garden City,
Kansas; and Greeley, Colorado. <hi rend="smallcaps">IBP</hi>, for example,
has worked with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (<hi rend="smallcaps">INS</hi>) to recruit workers
from Mexico and has been discussing the
creation of a new bracero-type program.</p>

<p>Diversification of the Latino occupational
structure has led to the urbanization of the
Hispanic population. Today Latinos live primarily
in Great Plains cities&#8211;Denver, Greeley,
Pueblo, Lubbock, Amarillo, Midland-Odessa,
Omaha, and Kansas City. In these cities,
Latino-owned businesses have altered the
Great Plains urban landscape, with Mexican
restaurants, Latino music shops, tortilla factories,
Spanish-language theaters and radio stations,
and bilingual churches.</p>

<p>Latinos are now an integral part of the labor
force in several Great Plains economic sectors,
and their cultural imprint is increasingly evident.
Mexican restaurants, which not so long
ago were considered exotic, are common even
in small Plains towns. Around Lubbock, Texas,
a "High Plains Mexican food" variant has
emerged, and in the South Platte and Arkansas
Valleys there is a thriving Hispano cuisine. An
essential ingredient of Mexican food&#8211;chiles&#8211;
are now planted extensively along the Arkansas
River and handpicked by Mexican immigrants.
Chile farms and chile harvest festivals
around Pueblo, Colorado, are key components
to the revitalization of that city. Politically,
Latino participation is most apparent in
the Texas High Plains and the Arkansas Valley,
where Hispanics now constitute as much as 50
percent of the population. Latino mayors,
sheriffs, and business leaders are common
in these regions. The economic boom of the
1990s exacerbated Great Plains labor shortages,
and a willing, mobile population of Mexicans
with a history of migration to the Great
Plains means that the sounds of Spanish will
continue to be heard well into the foreseeable
future.</p>
