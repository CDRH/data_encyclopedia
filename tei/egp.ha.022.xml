<head type="main">JIMENEZ, LUIS (b. 1940)</head>

<p>Luis Alfonso Jimenez Jr., one of the Americas'
most important Hispanic artists, was born on
July 14, 1940, in El Paso, Texas. He received
a bachelor of science degree in art and architecture
from the University of Texas in 1964.
The same year, he attended Ciudad Universitaria,
Mexico. He has been awarded the prestigious
Mid-Career Fellowship Awards at the
American Academy in Rome and the National
Endowment for the Arts, and the American
Institute of Architects Environmental Improvement
Award for <hi rend="italic">Vaquero</hi>, his work of
sculpture in Moody Park, Houston, Texas.
Numerous other commissions and exhibitions
are at institutions such as the National
Museum of American Art, Washington <hi rend="smallcaps">DC</hi>;
New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art; the
Art Institute of Chicago; the Modern Art Museum
of Fort Worth; the San Antonio Museum
of Arts; and the Sheldon Memorial Art
Gallery, University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>

<p>Jimenez's technique in creating monumental
sculptures was learned in the workshop of
his father, a sign painter and neon sign maker.
He is widely known for his large, public, fiberglass
sculptures that are based on a contemporary
language and convey a "Tex-Mex"
flavor, inviting spirited dialogue not only
about their subject matter but also their medium.
He incorporates age-old Chicano and
Mexican icons that can be thought of in a
more popular idiom, and he challenges accepted
notions of the definition of art. His
vigorous, gestural drawings also are full of a
sense of pride in his Latino heritage.</p>
