<head type="main">TEJANOS</head>

<p>People of Mexican descent who live in Texas,
whether native or foreign-born, are generally
referred to as "Tejanos" by Spanish speakers.
The designation has been used since at least
the 1820s. The beginnings of Mexican-origin
inhabitants of Texas may be traced to the early
eighteenth century, when the Spanish established
several permanent settlements in what
eventually became the state of Texas. In 1821
Tejanos became citizens of Mexico, in 1836
members of the Republic of Texas, and in 1845,
following annexation, citizens of the United
States. In the late twentieth century, their
numbers approximated five million.</p>

<p>Historically, mainstream society has treated
Tejanos as an ethnic/racial group, and much
of what is Tejano history consists of resistance
(at times violent, but generally peaceful)
against such forces as discrimination, racism,
labor exploitation, and nativism. But Tejanos
have also made a pronounced imprint on the
state by helping build its economy, enriching
the Texas literary corpus and its musical heritage,
contributing to the cultural mosaic that
is the Lone Star State, participating in politics
(there were more than 2,000 elected Tejano
o.cials in the 1990s), and fighting in every
foreign war.</p>

<p>Today, most Tejanos are United States–
born. But their adjustment to mainstream society
runs the gamut from those who remain
culturally "Mexican," to many who feel comfortable
being bilingual and bicultural, to
those who have become totally Americanized.
Mexican Americans considering themselves
Tejanos would readily concede their admiration
for such aspects of Mexican heritage as
the Spanish language, Mexican music, Mexican
religious and cultural traditions, fiestas,
and Mexican cuisine and folklore. Simultaneously,
they embrace most of what is representative
of Anglo-American life and culture.</p>
