<head type="main">FRONTIER VIOLENCE</head>

<p>When people think of nineteenth-century <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> towns such as <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City, Kansas</placeName>, <placeName rend="settlement" key="ne.oga" reg="Ogallala, Nebraska">Ogallala, Nebraska</placeName>, and <placeName rend="state" key="sd.dea" reg="Deadwood, South Dakota">Deadwood, South Dakota</placeName>, they often conjure up images of frontier violence. One image that comes to mind is of <persName reg="Dillon, Matt">Marshal Matt Dillon</persName>, with six-shooters drawn, facing an unruly cowboy on a dusty street in <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City</placeName>. Someone else might imagine a pair of luckless horse thieves being dispatched by vigilantes in Ogallala. Still another image might be of the cowardly assassination of <persName reg="Hickok, James Butler (Wild Bill)">Wild Bill Hickok</persName> by <persName reg="McCall, Jack">Jack McCall</persName> in <placeName rend="settlement" key="sd.dea" reg="Deadwood, South Dakota">Deadwood</placeName>'s <placeName rend="saloon" key="sal.s10" reg="Saloon #10">Saloon #10</placeName>. Whatever the image, the overall picture is of a <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> frontier where violence and disorder ruled the day. No other region of the <placeName rend="country" key="usa" reg="United States of America">United States</placeName> is given this distinction more than the <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName>.</p>

<p>Why do people perceive the American <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> as violent? Nobody pictures the <geogName rend="region" reg="Canadian Plains">Canadian Plains</geogName> in the same manner. Instead of gunfighters, highwaymen, and vigilantes, images of the <orgName rend="law" key="law.nwmp" reg="North-West Mounted Police">North-West Mounted Police</orgName>, with their connotations of law and order, define the <geogName rend="region" reg="Canadian Plains">Canadian Plains</geogName>. The American <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName>, however, were never as violent as popular culture assumes. Since the publication of <persName reg="Dykstra, Robert">Robert Dykstra</persName>'s <hi rend="italic">The Cattle Towns</hi> (1968), scholars have begun, although not without protest, to chip away at the myth of a violent <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName>. <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City</placeName>, as <persName reg="Dykstra, Robert">Dykstra</persName> points out, witnessed an average of only 1.5 homicides per year during its ten years as a cattle-trading center; it was hardly a town plagued by lethal violence. <placeName rend="settlement" key="ne.oga" reg="Ogallala, Nebraska">Ogallala, Nebraska</placeName>, the "cowboy capital" of the <placeName rend="state" key="ne" reg="Nebraska">Cornhusker State</placeName> and often described as the "Gomorrah of the trail," recorded only six killings during its ten years (1875â€“84) as an end-of-the-trail cattle town.</p>

<p>The driving force behind the creation of a violent <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> has been the media: nineteenth- century newspapers, dime novels, and popular histories and twentieth-century television Westerns and Hollywood. Without the nineteenth-century media and dime novelists, the names of <persName reg="McCarty, Henry (Billy the Kid)">Billy the Kid</persName>, <persName reg="Earp, Wyatt">Wyatt Earp</persName>, <persName reg="Hickock, James Butler (Wild Bill)">Wild Bill Hickok</persName>, and <persName reg="Masterson, Bat">Bat Masterson</persName> would not be the cultural icons they are today. In 1867 <hi rend="italic"><orgName rend="publication" key="pub.hnmm" reg="Harper's New Monthly Magazine">Harper's New Monthly Magazine</orgName></hi> published an article on <persName reg="Hickock, James Butler (Wild Bill)">James Butler Hickok</persName>, better known as <persName reg="Hickock, James Butler (Wild Bill)">Wild Bill</persName>, and his <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> exploits. This widely read article exaggerated <persName reg="Hickock, James Butler (Wild Bill)">Wild Bill</persName>'s prowess with a gun and the number of men he had killed. He quickly became a frontier hero and a popular subject of dime novelists who pushed the number of <persName reg="Hickock, James Butler (Wild Bill)">Hickok</persName> killings higher with each new publication; by the time of his death in 1876 he was credited with more than 100 killings. Thereafter, <persName reg="Hickock, James Butler (Wild Bill)">Hickok</persName> became a frontier icon, and the Kansas towns where he lived and worked&#8211;<placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.hay" reg="Hays, Kansas">Hays</placeName>, <placeName rend="state" key="ks.abi" reg="Abilene, Kansas">Abilene</placeName>, and <placeName rend="state" key="sd.dea" reg="Deadwood, South Dakota">Deadwood</placeName>&#8211;became ingrained in popular culture as places where lethal violence ruled.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most lethal of the <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> towns, at least in popular culture, was <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City</placeName>. Founded in 1872 and for more than ten years an end-of-the-trail cattle town, <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City</placeName> became a favorite of eastern journalists. In 1878 the <hi rend="italic"><orgName rend="publication" key="pub.npg" reg="National Police Gazette">National Police Gazette</orgName></hi> published a story about a <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City</placeName> shooting that introduced <persName reg="Earp, Wyatt">Wyatt Earp</persName> to the American public. In 1883 news reports about the "Dodge City War" (a nonlethal conflict) were picked up by the <orgName rend="newspaper" key="news.ap" reg="Associated Press">Associated Press</orgName>, sparking nationwide commentary on western lawlessness and confirming in the public mind that <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City</placeName> was in fact the "Sodom of the West." During the twentieth century books such as <persName reg="Lake, Stuart N.">Stuart N. Lake</persName>'s <hi rend="italic"><persName reg="Earp, Wyatt">Wyatt Earp</persName>: Frontier Marshal</hi> (1931) and popular television Westerns such as <hi rend="italic">Gunsmoke</hi> kept <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City</placeName> at the forefront of frontier iconography.</p>

<p>To be fair, the <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> did experience its share of violence during the first few decades after the Civil War. The federal government fought wars against the <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.com" reg="Comanche">Comanches</orgName> and <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.kio" reg="Kiowa">Kiowas</orgName> on the Southern Plains and the <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.ls" reg="Lakota Sioux">Lakota Sioux</orgName> and <orgName rend="tribe" key="tri.che" reg="Cheyenne">Cheyenne</orgName> on the <geogName rend="region" reg="Northern Plains">Northern Plains</geogName>. <persName reg="James Butler (Wild Bill), Hickok">Wild Bill Hickok</persName>, <persName reg="Masterson, Bat">Bat Masterson</persName>, and <persName reg="Earp, Wyatt">Wyatt Earp</persName> patrolled the <placeName rend="state" key="ks" reg="Kansas">Kansas</placeName> cow towns as armed lawmen. Gunmen, lawmen, and innocent bystanders were gunned down on the streets and in the saloons of <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City</placeName>, <placeName rend="settlement" key="ne.oga" reg="Ogallala, Nebraska">Ogallala</placeName>, and <placeName rend="settlement" key="sd.dea" reg="Deadwood, South Dakota">Deadwood</placeName>. And vigilantes hanged and shot victims in every <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> state and territory. The problem is that such violent incidents were episodic rather than epidemic and should not be used to define an entire region. The nineteenth-century <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Plains</geogName> were probably far less violent than the contemporary <geogName rend="region" reg="South">South</geogName> or eastern urban centers such as <placeName rend="settlement" key="ny.nyc" reg="New York City, New York">New York City</placeName>.</p>

<p>Despite the relatively undramatic historical reality of violence in the <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> the public will always believe the myth. Hollywood will continue to make movies about the wild and violent <geogName rend="region" reg="The West">West</geogName>, popular writers will still produce fictional accounts of gunfighters and lawmen, and untrained historians will continue to define the region through the eyes of <persName reg="McCarty, Henry (Billy the Kid)">Billy the Kid</persName>, <persName reg="Hickok, James Butler (Wild Bill)">Wild Bill Hickok</persName>, and <persName reg="Earp, Wyatt">Wyatt Earp</persName>.</p>

<p><geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> communities also keep the idea of a violent <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> alive and kicking through tourism. While driving across the <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> travelers can visit dozens of Boot Hill cemeteries, including those in <placeName rend="settlement" key="ne.oga" reg="Ogallala, Nebraska">Ogallala</placeName> and <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City</placeName>. <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.abi" reg="Abilene, Kansas">Abilene, Kansas</placeName>, offers the Wild Bill Rodeo. In <placeName rend="settlement" key="sd.dea" reg="Deadwood, South Dakota">Deadwood, South Dakota</placeName>, tourists can compete in quick-draw contests at the annual Wild Bill Days or take a tour of <placeName rend="cemetery" key="cem.mmc" reg="Mount Moriah Cemetery">Mount Moriah Cemetery</placeName>, where <persName reg="Hickock, James Butler (Wild Bill)">Hickok</persName> is buried next to <persName reg="Calamity jane">Calamity Jane</persName>. At <placeName rend="settlement" key="ks.dc" reg="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City</placeName> visitors can stay overnight at the Boot Hill Bed and Breakfast while enjoying the annual Dodge City Days. It's hard to blame writers, producers, and <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Great Plains</geogName> towns for perpetuating the image of frontier violence. After all, <persName reg="Eastwood, Clint">Clint Eastwood</persName> will always sell more tickets at the box office as a mysterious gunslinger than as a <geogName rend="region" reg="Great Plains">Plains</geogName> sodbuster. It's good entertainment, and the public wants their myths and heroes to be left alone.</p>
