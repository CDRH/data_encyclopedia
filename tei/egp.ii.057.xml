<p><orgName rend="business" key="bus.wd" reg="Wall Drug">Wall Drug</orgName> is a world-famous attraction located in <placeName rend="settlement" key="sd.wal" reg="Wall, South Dakota">Wall, South Dakota</placeName>. The community of Wall is situated on the east "wall" of the <geogName rend="region" reg="Badlands">Badlands</geogName>, just fifty-four miles southeast of <placeName rend="settlement" key="sd.rc" reg="Rapid City, South Dakota">Rapid City</placeName>. <orgName rend="business" key="bus.wd" reg="Wall Drug">Wall Drug</orgName> began as a country pharmacy serving local farmers and ranchers and the residents of a small, western <placeName rend="state" key="sd" reg="South Dakota">South Dakota</placeName> community.</p>

<p>In the early years of the Depression, <persName reg="Hustead, Theodore Edward">Theodore Edward Hustead</persName>, a recent graduate of pharmacy school, purchased the existing drugstore in Wall using a three-thousand-dollar inheritance from his father. Because local farmers and ranchers were dried out, they had little money to spend in town. For a number of years, <persName reg="Hustead, Theodore Edward">Ted</persName> and his wife and partner, <persName reg="Hustead, Dorothy">Dorothy</persName>, noticed a steady stream of autos headed west on <placeName rend="highway" key="high.us16a" reg="U.S. Route 16A">Route 16<hi rend="smallcaps"></hi>A</placeName>. The problem was that very few of these autos were taking the time to pull off the two-lane highway. In the summer of 1936, during a particularly hot spell, <persName reg="Hustead, Dorothy">Dorothy</persName> had the inspiration of offering free ice water to travelers. <persName reg="Hustead, Theodore Edward">Ted</persName> immediately set to work making signs, modeled after the old Burma Shave highway signs. Each phrase of the message was written on a board, and all the boards were then placed along the highway, spaced so that people could read each sign as they drove along. Advertising a free, desirable product to get people into the store proved to be immensely successful. More than sixty years later, with many signs located in far-off places, <orgName rend="business" key="bus.wd" reg="Wall Drug">Wall Drug</orgName> has grown to a 76,000-square-foot complex that includes two malls. A thirsty traveler can still find free ice water there, along with five-cent coffee.</p>
