<p>As a twentieth-century phenomenon, the
Plains aerospace industry evolved from early
interest in airline travel as a means to cope
with widely separated population centers and
the tendency of overland transportation systems
to follow traditional eastâ€“west routes. As
the tempo of air transportation accelerated,
pioneering aircraft manufacturers in the
Great Plains began to appear, especially during
the years following World War I.</p>

<p>A number of builders survived hard years
of competition and erratic financing, and major
aircraft-manufacturing entities took many
years to mature. With its widely scattered population
and agrarian focus, the region always
presented major problems in acquiring a large
force of technically skilled workers, especially
in the case of advanced technologies such as
aviation. Manufacturers in the area tended
to succeed with smaller, less technically advanced
aircraft. These "light plane" designs
generated growing numbers in the general
aviation sector as distinguished from commercial
airliners and military aircraft.</p>

<p>The advent of World War II dramatically
changed this picture. Many production centers
were organized throughout the Great Plains,
partly to locate new aircraft plants away from
vulnerable sites near coastlines. Thousands of
workers relocated near these new plants; many
remained in the region. As the cold war era
evolved after 1945, national defense requirements
kept many of the wartime centers active
in the construction of a new generation of
military aircraft. Moreover, postwar prosperity
provided a rapidly growing market for a
variety of new general aviation aircraft and
generated a significant backlog of orders for
components used in the postwar generation of
bigger, faster commercial passenger transports.
Also, succeeding generations of aircraft
relied increasingly on electronic and computerized
equipment. During the mid-1950s, the
aerospace industry appeared, indicating growing
dimensions of rocketry and space research.
Electronics and computer companies proliferated.
Smaller, specialized firms like these often
succeeded in supplying components and systems
management expertise to the aerospace
industry, even though the national centers of
aerospace production lay elsewhere.</p>

<p>Several of the areas where aviation and aerospace
manufacturing occurred were clearly in
the Great Plains region. Moreover, a number
of metropolitan centers that lay just outside its
boundaries began to employ such a large number
of aviation workers that their "footprint"
clearly affected considerable innumerable employees
who actually lived within the Plains.</p>

<p>In Canada, the center of aviation manufacturing
remained in the southeastern part of
the country. Following World War II, however,
military training bases gave momentum
to regional fabricators and suppliers. As the
oil and gas industries emerged on the Prairies
and the population mushroomed, a technical
and industrial infrastructure flourished that
contributed to the aviation/aerospace industry.
These activities emerged in metropolitan
areas such as Edmonton and Calgary. Firms in
these cities not only built subassemblies for a
variety of major eastern Canadian manufacturers
but also offered comprehensive electronic
technologies for communications and
navigational systems.</p>

<p>In the United States, aircraft manufacturing
after World War I built on the enthusiasm of
wartime aviation and the availability of venture
capital. During the 1920s, although a variety
of optimistic companies sprang up in several
states, manufacturers of general aviation
aircraft succeeded most often, especially
around Wichita, Kansas. There, the lack of
surface transportation and the energy of wildcatters
in the oil business created a market for
smaller, agile aircraft. Early builders who
eventually survived included Beechcraft and
Cessna, specializing in general aviation designs
intended to carry four to six passengers.
During World War II, these companies turned
out thousands of primary trainers for military
flight schools.</p>

<p>Wartime necessity also stimulated smaller
fabricators of aviation hardware throughout
the region and brought major manufacturing
plants to urban areas such as Omaha and Lincoln,
Nebraska, Kansas City, Kansas, and Fort
Worth, Texas. Overnight, the latter made Texas
one of the largest aircraft production centers
in the United States, turning out thousands
of trainers, <hi rend="smallcaps">P</hi>-51 Mustang fighters, and <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>-24
Liberator bombers. The area's concentration
of suppliers and workers made it a postwar
center as well, producing a long line of
jet bombers and fighter aircraft such as the
Lockheed <hi rend="smallcaps">F</hi>-16. Wichita also produced large
military aircraft, and new Boeing facilities
there continued to build components for <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>-52
bombers as well as a long line of postwar Boeing
transport planes. In Colorado, the Denver-
Boulder locale emerged as a postwar center for
aerospace research, producing rocket vehicle
components and electronic systems for military
and civil applications.</p>

<p>In 2000 manufacturers across the region
produced light planes, corporate jets, supersonic
fighters, space-flight hardware, and a
wide range of electronic aerospace products.
A number of ventures involved foreign firms,
reflecting the era's global economy.</p>
