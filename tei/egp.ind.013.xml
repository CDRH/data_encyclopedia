<head type="main">CLARK, JIM (b. 1944)</head>

<p>Once a high school dropout in Plainview,
Texas, James H. Clark became a university
professor, then a business entrepreneur who
founded three billion-dollar companies: Silicon
Graphics Inc., Netscape Communications
Corp., and Healtheon Corp., now Healtheon/
Web <hi rend="smallcaps">MD</hi>. He is still involved in the latter enterprise,
which used the Internet to revolutionize
the handling of medical records. In addition,
he serves as chairman of <hi rend="smallcaps">MYCFO</hi>, an Internetbased
money-management firm; Shutterfly
.com, a Web site for digital photo hobbyists;
and SmartPipes, Inc., a business networking
company. He serves on the board of directors
of two genetics companies, <hi rend="smallcaps">DNA</hi>sciences and
Kiva Genetics, and is an investor in Shockwave.
com, an entertainment site. His customary
method of operation is to see an emerging
trend, form a company to take advantage of it,
then turn its operation over to management
professionals.</p>

<p>Jim Clark was born in Plainview, Texas, on
March 23, 1944. His mother worked in a doctor's
office; his father did odd jobs and had a
drinking problem and a violent temper. His
parents divorced when he was fourteen, leaving
his mother to support the family, which
included Jim's brother and sister, on $225 a
month. Clark attended Plainview High School
but was bored. He was suspended in his junior
year for talking back to a teacher. He never
returned. Instead, he joined the navy. After
completing his four-year hitch, Clark passed
his high school equivalency test and entered
college. By 1971 he had received a master's degree
in physics from the University of New
Orleans, and in 1974 he earned a doctorate in
computer science at the University of Utah.</p>

<p>By age thirty-six, he was an associate professor
of electrical engineering at Stanford
University, working in the computer systems
laboratory. While in this post, he invented
a breakthrough integrated-circuit chip that
made possible new developments in three-dimensional
graphics. To build upon this invention,
he started Silicon Graphics in 1981
and left Stanford. Unfortunately for Clark, the
venture capitalist who had helped fund the
new company ended up controlling it. Disillusioned
and not much richer, Clark next
founded Netscape Communications to develop
and market an innovative Internet
browser created by programmer Marc Andreesen.
This time Clark made sure he retained
control. When Netscape merged into
America Online, he left that association with a
personal take of $1.5 billion. This nest egg gave
him the operating capital to start his subsequent
successful businesses.</p>
