<p>Gateway, Inc., a South Dakota company, pioneered
direct marketing of computers to individuals
for personal applications in their
homes. Its headquarters moved from North
Sioux City, South Dakota, to San Diego, California,
in 1998, but it still maintains its North
Sioux City location, as well as a location in
Sioux Falls. The company went public in 1993
and is now listed in the New York Stock Exchange
as <hi rend="smallcaps">GTW</hi>. Formerly known as Gateway
2000, the "2000" was dropped from the name
in 1998.</p>

<p>Ted Waitt started Gateway in 1985 in the
abandoned farmhouse on his family's cattle
ranch with $10,000 capital from his grandmother.
Waitt was twenty-three years old. The
growth of the company has been remarkable.
By 1997 its revenues had reached $6.3 billion.
It then ranked seventh among its competitors
&#8211;behind <hi rend="smallcaps">IBM</hi>, Dell, and Compaq but above
Apple, <hi rend="smallcaps">NCR</hi>, and Silicon Graphics. Gateway
has manufacturing facilities in the United
States, Ireland, and Malaysia and showrooms,
called Gateway Country Stores, in thirty-seven
American cities. The number of stores,
however, was being greatly reduced in 2003 in
an effort to reduce expenses.</p>

<p>Gateway maintains its ties to its Great
Plains and cattle ranch roots. The familiar
Holstein cow spots on its shipping boxes are
known around the world. The spots are prominent
in its logo and cover its buildings. In the
fall of 2002, Gateway updated its logo with a G
(the "power on" symbol on its side) inside a
single cow spot.</p>

<p>The company wins numerous industry
awards year after year. Its founder, Ted Waitt,
is recognized by journalists as one of America's
leading executives and strategists.</p>
