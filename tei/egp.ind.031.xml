<head type="main">INSURANCE</head>

<p>The Great Plains insurance industry has a spirit
and tenacity that reflect the speculative and
adventurous nature of the region in which it
was born. The Great Plains insurance industry
was created by losses from prairie fires, lightning
strikes, and windstorms. Other forces
such as the uncertainty of crop prices and cattle
prices as well as the high costs of farming
operations led to the organization of a substantial
part of the agricultural community
into the Grange and Farmers Alliance movements.
From these issues and organizing movements
many Great Plains insurance companies
were started. Other insurance companies were
formed on the principles of cooperation, mutual
aid, benevolence, and care for others.
Most provided an alternative to the eastern
stock insurance companies, which did not
understand the Great Plains conditions and
whose insurance coverage was unaffordable.
Some of the early companies still in business
today are Portage Mutual (Manitoba, 1884),
Northwest German Farmers Mutual Insurance
(South Dakota, 1887), Farmers Alliance Mutual
(Kansas, 1888), Kansas Mutual (1895),
Wawanesa Mutual (Manitoba, 1896), and the
Oklahoma Farmers Union (1907).</p>

<p>In 1998 the Great Plains insurance industry
consisted of more than 600 domestic companies
writing $35 billion in U.S. property and
liability insurance, $133 billion of the U.S. life
insurance premiums, and more than $1 trillion
in life insurance. There are 87 domestic
Prairie Province insurance companies out of
more than 200 general Canadian insurance
companies. The Canadian companies insure
$4 billion worth of Great Plains property and
liability (21 percent of the Canadian total) as
well as $1 billion in accident and sickness and
$3 billion in life insurance.</p>

<p>Losses in the Great Plains are caused by tornados
(there were 508 in 1996, or 44 percent of
the U.S. total) and strong winds, but the most
significant losses result from hail damage.
Great Plains property premiums have escalated
due to hail losses to real property and
autos. As a result of high losses, some companies
withdrew from the Great Plains property
insurance markets. However, since 1993,
most Great Plains insurance companies have
become profitable with an acceptable adjusted
loss ratio and net investment income. The
Great Plains insurance customer continues to
receive a high level of service from the insurance
industry, and the cost of insurance continues
to remain below the U.S. average, with
annual auto insurance expenditures of $523
versus the national average of $665. Healthcare
costs continue to increase; however,
health-care insurance premiums are below the
national average. For example, the Great
Plains average hospital cost of $749 per patient
day in 1999 was well below the U.S. average of
$968.</p>

<p>The insurance industry makes a significant
contribution to the Great Plains economy:
$340 million in life insurance premium taxes
and $1.14 billion in property and casualty
insurance taxes are paid annually. As employers,
Great Plains insurance companies
also pay Social Security taxes as well as other
taxes, licenses, and fees. The economic multiplier
effect results in a substantial economic
contribution to the Plains economy. The insurance
industry output averages about 2 percent
of each state's gross state product.</p>

<p>Changes in U.S. agricultural policy and
world agricultural markets have forced Plains
farmers to proactively analyze grain markets
and manage crop revenue. New crop insurance
approaches provide multiperil insurance
coverage for crop revenue and market price
fluctuations. National and global competition
is forcing a revision in underwriting models
for personal and commercial lines as Great
Plains insurance companies continue to look
for better methods to provide affordable and
profitable insurance. Technology changes are
revising marketing practices as direct marketers
such as the <hi rend="smallcaps">USAA</hi> Group strive to take advantage
of electronic databases and electronic
marketing opportunities.</p>

<p>The Great Plains agricultural community,
which established the Great Plains insurance
industry, continues to decline in employment
and in proportion of total value added. It has
been replaced by economic clusters of airplane
manufacturing, mining, petroleum, and
various light global and domestic industries
throughout the Great Plains region. In general,
the Great Plains continues to be served by
domestic insurance companies and independent
agents, particularly in the commercial
lines, but the trend is to increase personal lines
market share by direct writers and national
insurance companies. Insurance companies
will continue to consolidate, to merge with
banks, to demutualize, to market across national
boundaries, and to engage in electronic
commerce. These trends will challenge the domestic
Great Plains insurance market and may
ultimately alter the state regulatory management
of the industry. The resiliency and tenacity
of the Great Plains insurance industry
founders will need to be remembered if these
challenges are to be successfully met.</p>
