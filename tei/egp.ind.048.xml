<head type="main">PHILLIPS PETROLEUM</head>

<p>Phillips Petroleum Company is a major diversified
energy firm engaged internationally in
oil and gas exploration and production. Phillips
refines, markets, and transports petroleum,
and it also gathers, processes, and markets
natural gas, principally in the United
States. In addition, the company manufactures
and sells chemicals and plastics worldwide.</p>

<p>Two brothers, Frank (1873–1950) and Lee
Eldas (1876–1944) Phillips, entered the oil
business in 1903. In 1905 they drilled their first
gusher when the Anna Anderson No. 1, located
in Indian Territory, hit oil on leased land
owned by an eight-year-old Delaware Indian
girl of that name. The Phillips brothers remained
in the oil business until 1915, when
they decided to leave petroleum for banking.
However, they soon realized that U.S. involvement
in World War I would precipitate a steep
rise in petroleum demand. They reconsidered
their decision to leave the oil business and incorporated
Phillips Petroleum Company in
Bartlesville, Oklahoma, on June 13, 1917.</p>

<p>After discovery of the huge Panhandle gas
field in 1918, Phillips profited from the burgeoning
natural gas industry. In particular,
Phillips specialized in the extraction of liquids
from natural gas. By the mid-1920s, Phillips
was the largest producer of natural gas liquids
in the United States.</p>

<p>Since the late 1920s, consumers have recognized
Phillips for its distinctive Phillips 66 service
stations. Phillips originally entered the retail
gasoline business to profit from the rapidly
increasing demand for automobile fuel. In
1927 Phillips opened its first oil refinery near
Borger in the Texas Panhandle, and in the same
year the company opened its first service station
in Wichita, Kansas.</p>

<p>During the Great Depression, Phillips
posted its first loss ($5.7 million), and its stock
price fell from $32 to $3 per share. The company
persevered. During World War II, Phillips
contributed to innovations in synthetic
rubber and high-octane aviation gasoline. In
the late 1940s Phillips entered the chemical
business when it formed Phillips Chemical
Company, a wholly owned subsidiary that operated
a large facility by the Houston Ship
Channel. In the 1950s Phillips began producing
a polyolefin plastic trademarked as Marlex.
Marlex was the most common plastic used
in the manufacture of hula hoops, which became
ubiquitous in that decade.</p>

<p>Beginning in the mid-1940s, Phillips explored
for petroleum internationally, first in
Venezuela, Canada, and Colombia and later in
the Middle East. Phillips pioneered the industry
in Alaska when it participated in a drilling
project at Cook Inlet in 1962 and also at Prudhoe
Bay on the North Slope. Phillips's most
spectacular discovery was the massive Ekofisk
field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.
Phillips also participated in a project to manufacture
and ship liquefied natural gas (<hi rend="smallcaps">LNG</hi>)
from Alaska to Japan during the late 1960s.</p>

<p>During the 1980s, Phillips Petroleum survived
hostile takeover attempts by groups led
by T. Boone Pickens Jr. and Carl C. Ichan.
Remaining independent was an expensive
proposition that tripled Phillips's corporate
debt. Phillips's financial condition, exacerbated
by turmoil in the oil industry, caused it
to either sell off or shut down some of its assets,
including fertilizer, carbon black, and
synthetic rubber plants. By the 1990s, Phillips
had combined restructuring efforts with continued
international and domestic business
expansion. Phillips celebrated its eightieth anniversary
in 1997 and remains the only major
U.S. oil company still bearing its founders'
name.</p>
