<head type="main">LOUGHEED, JAMES (1854-1925)</head>

<p>Sir James Alexander Lougheed was a prominent
Calgary lawyer and entrepreneur and,
from December 10, 1889, until his death, a
member of the Senate of Canada. Of Protestant
Irish descent, Lougheed was born in
Brampton on September 1, 1854, was raised in
Toronto, where he trained as a lawyer, and
settled in Fort Calgary in 1883, just as the Canadian
Pacific Railway was being constructed
there. He married Belle Hardisty, daughter of
William Hardisty, a prominent Hudson's Bay
Company factor; they eventually had four
sons and two daughters.</p>

<p>Lougheed's law practice grew rapidly, particularly
as solicitor for the railway, and he
invested heavily, and profitably, in Calgary
real estate. He constructed numerous rental
properties in the downtown area, culminating
in the Lougheed Building (1912), an office
building with a 1,500-seat theater. Lougheed
was leader of the Conservative Party in the
Canadian Senate from 1906 until his death,
and he was government leader from 1911 to
1921. He served in the federal government under
Sir Robert Borden as minister without
portfolio (1911-18), minister of soldiers' civil
reestablishment (1918-20), and (under Arthur
Meighen) as minister of the interior, superintendent
general of Indian affairs, and minister
of mines (1920-21). Lougheed's diplomatic
skills were a great asset in securing the passage
of government measures. He always was a vigorous
representative of western Canada in Ottawa.
Perhaps his greatest work was the resettlement
of demobilized soldiers, many of
them in western Canada, following World
War I. Sir James Lougheed died in Ottawa on
November 2, 1925.</p>
