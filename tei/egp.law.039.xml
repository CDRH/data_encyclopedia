<head type="main">OVERLAND TRAIL CONSTITUTIONS</head>

<p>Travelers on the Overland Trail to the Pacific,
after crossing the Missouri River, entered a
territory without enforceable law, courts, or
police. Those who journeyed in companies
soon discovered the need for government,
and, until about 1854, most companies drafted
constitutions and sometimes bylaws.</p>

<p>Constitutions were seldom-detailed codes of
government. They did not seek to regulate specific
behavior but to obtain a reasonable degree
of conformity within a social, economic, and
legal environment conducive to democracy. Although
a few companies had members sign
their charters, implying that they thought constitutions
were compacts and perhaps even personal
contracts, the dominant legal theory was
that overland constitutions were organic acts
outlining the procedures for identifying and
judging unacceptable conduct. Another common
operative theory was that companies
were organic wholes, peripatetic governments
possessing all sovereign authority, a fact demonstrated
by those constitutions establishing
representative legislatures and authorizing
capital punishment. Punishment was seldom
inflicted, as offending parties could avoid
most physical sanctions (except for the death
penalty) by departing from the company. That
reality did not undercut but instead reinforced
the purpose of constitutions, because they
sought social cooperation, not legal discipline.
Once a wrongdoer left, harmony was restored.
Lack of harmony was the chief cause terminating
company governance. When pressures of
overland travel destroyed harmony, emigrants
knew the constitution no longer functioned.</p>

<p>The legal and social principles shaping constitutional
policy on the Overland Trail were
based on mediation, not legislation, to obtain
harmony within diversity, not unanimity
through legislation. These constitutions have
a unique importance for American history.
There is no more reliable way to measure the
constitutional notions of average nineteenth-century
citizens than to examine Overland
Trail constitutions.</p>
