<head type="main">DEVERELL, REX (b. 1941)</head>

<p>Rex Deverell is a Canadian dramatist noted
for his children's plays, his full-length plays,
and his time as a writer in residence at the
Globe Theatre, Regina, from 1975 to 1990. He
was born July 17, 1941, in Toronto, raised in
Orillia, Ontario, and received a bachelor's
from McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario,
in 1963, a bachelor of divinity from Mc-
Master in 1966, and a master of sacred theology
from Union Theological Seminary in New
York in 1967. He began writing plays in 1966
and has been a prolific writer ever since, with
more than twenty children's plays, fifteen fulllength
plays, and half a dozen plays commissioned
by various groups. He has participated
in five collective productions and has been an
active playwright for <hi rend="smallcaps">CBC</hi> radio.</p>

<p>At the Globe Theatre he began as a children's
playwright and wrote roughly one children's
play a year. His first full-length play,
<title level="m">Boiler Room Suite</title> (1977), became his best
known and most produced. He wrote a number
of Saskatchewan-specific documentaries
like <title level="m">Medicare!</title> (1980), on the introduction of
socialized medicine to Canada and the subsequent
doctors strike, as well as <title level="m">Number 1 Hard</title>
(1978) and <title level="m">Black Powder: Estevan 1931</title> (1981).
He has also written musicals, including <title level="m">Mandarin Oranges</title> (1985/1990), and plays that explore
religion, including <title level="m">Righteousness</title> (1983),
about Saint Augustine.</p>

<p>Plays produced in a single year, 1985, give a
good cross section of Deverell's work. That
year was the centenary of the North-West Rebellion,
and Deverell composed both a fivehour
radio drama for the cbc, <title level="m">The Riel Commission</title>,
and a play for the Globe, <title level="m">Beyond Batoche</title>. He also wrote a musical, a children's
play, and another radio drama and worked on
a collective show in 1985.</p>
