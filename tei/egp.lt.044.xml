<p>Born June 3, 1936, in Wichita Falls, Texas, to
Hazel Rugh McIver and Jefferson McMurtry,
Lawrence Jefferson McMurtry grew up with
ranch hands and cowboys. He received a
bachelor of arts degree from the University of
North Texas and a master of arts degree from
Rice University and studied creative writing
at Stanford. He married Josephine Ballard on
July 15, 1959; they divorced in 1966. He has one
son, James Lawrence. McMurtry taught creative
writing at Rice from 1963 to 1969 and
now lives in Archer City, Texas, where he runs
a bookstore called Booked Up.</p>

<p>McMurtry has published twenty-one novels
and much nonfiction, and he has received
numerous literary awards. His trail-driving
novel, <title level="m">Lonesome Dove</title> (1985), received the
Spur Award of the Western Writers of America, the Texas Institute of Letters Prize, and a
<title level="m">Pulitzer Prize</title> (1986). McMurtry has written
sequels to all of his most popular books. He
followed the characters of Lonesome Dove in
sequels, prequels, and the television miniseries
films <title level="m">The Streets of Laredo</title> (1995), Return
to <title level="m">Lonesome Dove</title> (1993), and <title level="m">Dead Man's Walk</title> (1996), but he has never managed to improve
on the originals. <title level="m">The Last Picture Show</title>
(1966) was reprised in <title level="m">Texasville</title> (1987), and
<title level="m">Duane's Depressed</title> (1999) and other works are
linked by their characters.</p>

<p>What makes McMurtry's Lonesome Dove
one of the best Westerns ever written is his
ability to combine a rip-snorting story full
of wonderful characters with a history of and
elegy for America's westward migration. <title level="m">Lonesome Dove</title> joins <title level="m">Horseman, Pass By</title> (1961) and
<title level="m">Leaving Cheyenne</title> (1963) as McMurtry's Texas
trilogy. McMurtry's <title level="m">In a Narrow Grave</title> (1968)
collects many of his published essays.</p>

<p>Most of McMurtry's novels have a certain
wistfulness. Sadness and laconic humor, occasioned
by loneliness and an awareness of the
uncertainties of life, run through his work in
an insistent refrain.</p>
