<p>Born in St. Boniface, Manitoba, on March 22,
1909, Gabrielle Roy entered the world on
the threshold of the Great Plains, whose
skies, towns, fields, and people she eventually
painted with loving strokes in articles, stories,
and novels.</p>

<p>Roy graduated with honors from high
school and received her teaching certificate in
1929. In 1937, unfulfilled by her teaching career
in Manitoba, she traveled to Europe, ostensibly
to study acting. Returning to Canada on the
eve of World War II, Roy settled in Montreal,
where from 1939 to 1945 she enjoyed considerable
success as a journalist, publishing more
than 100 articles and short stories. This apprenticeship
honed her craft and allowed her
to travel throughout Canada, meeting the people
who would eventually populate her fiction.</p>

<p>In 1945 the publication of her first novel,
<title level="m">Bonheur d'occasion</title>, brought her immediate
renown. Easily Roy's best-known work, this
award-winning expos√© of the poor, Frenchspeaking
population of Montreal gave new direction
to the French Canadian novel.</p>

<p>The majority of Roy's writing individualizes
the ethnic groups who settled in Canada's
Great Plains, documenting the land and the
human struggles there through the screen of
personal experience and recollection. Whether
a Franco-Manitoban family, a dying and careworn
Ukrainian woman, or immigrant children,
Roy's characters give voice to heretofore
silent populations in works such as <title level="m">La Route d'Altamont</title> (1966) and <title level="m">Ces enfants de ma vie</title>
(1977).</p>

<p>The recipient of three Governor General's
Literary Awards for fiction and numerous
other honors, Roy died in Quebec City on July
13, 1983. Gabrielle Roy's writings depict the
lives of the poor, the dispossessed, and the
lonely and transform them into sublime
truths about the human condition.</p>
