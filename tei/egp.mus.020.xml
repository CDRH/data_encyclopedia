<p>Born in Wahoo, Nebraska, on October 28,
1896, to Swedish immigrants, Howard Hanson
was a child prodigy, learning piano and cello
by the age of fourteen. As a high school junior
and senior, he conducted the Wahoo High
School Orchestra. Educated at Northwestern
University, Hanson was appointed dean of
music at the University of the Pacific in 1919
and then studied at the American Academy in
Rome, Italy, for three years. In 1924 he was
chosen by George Eastman to head the Eastman
School of Music at the University of
Rochester, a post he held until 1964.</p>

<p>Hanson composed seven symphonies, the
opera <title>Merrymount</title>, and several other orchestral
works. His fourth symphony, <title>Requiem</title>,
won a Pulitzer Prize in 1944. Several of
Hanson's chorales incorporated the poetry of
Walt Whitman. Hanson also promoted the
works of American composers in concert, on
phonograph records, and on the radio. Under
Hanson the Eastman School of Music became
one of the foremost music schools in America,
and he made music education a respected vocation.</p>

<p>Hanson's compositional style has been called
American romantic, influenced by music's romantic
period of the late 1800s. Hanson described
his music as springing from the soil of
his native Nebraska and reflecting the broad
prairies rather than the city. He died in Rochester,
New York, on February 26, 1981. Hanson's
birthplace in Wahoo is owned by the Saunders
County Historical Society and is open to the
public.</p>
