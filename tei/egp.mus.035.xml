<p>Willie Nelson is among America's best-known
country music stars. He was born in Abbot,
Texas, on April 30, 1933, to Ira and Myrtle
Nelson. Nelson's mother abandoned the family
when he was five years old, and he and his
sister, Bobbie Lee, were raised by their paternal
grandparents. The family was musical, and
both children studied music through mailorder
courses bought by their grandparents.
At age six Willie received his first guitar from
his grandfather.</p>

<p>Nelson's first musical performance came at
age ten, accompanied by Bobbie Lee on piano.
By the time he left high school he had his own
radio show. After a brief career in the air force,
he worked as a <hi rend="smallcaps">DJ</hi> and began writing songs,
including "Family Bible" and "Night Life." His
marriage, the first of several, fell apart, but his
career began to climb as his writing ability was
quickly recognized. He moved to Nashville in
1959, selling songs to Faron Young ("Hello
Walls") and Patsy Cline ("Crazy"). Although
his songs were popular when others performed
them, Willie himself never found
fame as a performer in Nashville. He took the
burning of his home there in 1970 as a sign
and returned to Texas.</p>

<p>In Texas he began working on his own music,
gradually creating a distinctive style that
mixed the sound of classic country with a hippie
sensibility and earning a reputation as a
musical outlaw. His two best-selling albums&#8211;
<title>Shotgun Willie</title> (1973) and <title>Phases and Stages</title>
(1974)&#8211;came out during this era. In 1975 he
switched to Columbia, which remained his label
until the 1990s. His first album for the new
label, <title>Red-Headed Stranger</title> (1975), proved to
be a breakthrough, confirming his image as an
outlaw and romantic hero.</p>

<p>In addition to musical performances, Nelson
also acted in several films, including <title>The Electric Horseman</title> (1979), <title>Honeysuckle Rose</title>
(1980), for which he also contributed the
soundtrack, <title>Barbarossa</title> (1982), and <title>Wag the Dog</title> (1997), among others. Nelson founded
and has served as the president of Farm Aid,
the nearly yearly musical benefit for American
farmers. Farm Aid concerts have raised millions
for struggling farmers and have taken
place in cities from Austin, Texas, and Lincoln,
Nebraska, to Columbia, South Carolina.</p>

<p>From 1984 to 1993 Nelson unsuccessfully
battled the <hi rend="smallcaps">IRS</hi> over $16.7 million in taxes
and fines dating back to 1972. Nelson blamed
the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse for
the mistakes. He eventually settled with the
agency. In 1994 he was arrested after police
found marijuana in the ashtray of his pickup
truck. The search was illegal, and the charges
were dropped.</p>

<p>Nelson's career has been propelled by his
own intense energy. He has recorded more
than 100 albums, written his autobiography,
and maintains a grueling concert schedule.
His status in American culture is that of
pop icon; he has even been the subject of a
novel (Richard "Kinky" Friedman's <title>Road Kill</title>
[1997]). Nelson actively campaigns for farm
relief, even testifying before Congress, as well
as for the legalization of marijuana. He has
cited Mexican American music, blues, western
swing, and Frank Sinatra as part of a large
list of musical influences; his own work has
ranged from country and pop to blues and
gospel.</p>
