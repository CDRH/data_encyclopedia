<head type="main">ECUERACAPA (d. 1793)</head>

<p>Ecueracapa (Leather Cape) was the name the
Spaniards of late-eighteenth-century New
Mexico gave to the principal chief of the Kotsoteka
Comanches. His Comanche name was
apparently <hi rend="italic">Koontyta'nikypa'a</hi>, or "Crane on a
Stake," but he was also called Cota de Malla
(or Maya), "Coat of Mail." This latter citation
has led to continuing confusion between the
New Mexican Ecueracapa and at least two
Texas Comanches also called Cota de Malla.</p>

<p>Ecueracapa first came to the attention of
the New Mexican Spaniards in late 1785 when,
after peace had been concluded with the Texas
Comanches, Governor Juan Bautista de Anza
managed to open communication with the
western Comanches. They sent word that Ecueracapa,
the "captain most distinguished as
much by his skill and valor in war as by his
adroitness and intelligence in political matters,"
was empowered to enter into negotiations,
which were conducted in early 1786. In
June 1786 a formal agreement was signed at
Pecos Pueblo marking the beginning of a
Comanche–New Mexican peace that endured
until 1821.</p>

<p>In the following years, Ecueracapa appears
a number of times in the historical record. In
May 1787 he forestalled retaliation against some
Jupe Comanche youths who had stolen Spanish
horses, and in early 1790 he was involved in
an ill-planned joint Spanish-Comanche expedition
against the Pawnees. In 1793 Ecueracapa
was "grievously wounded" on a campaign
against the Pawnees. He probably died
sometime that fall.</p>
