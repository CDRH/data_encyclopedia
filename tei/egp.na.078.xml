<head type="main">OSAGES</head>

<p>The Osages, Dhegiha Siouan speakers, believed
in the beginning that there was chaos in
the universe. Amid the chaos, the all-powerful,
mysterious, and invisible life force, Wakonda,
created order by organizing the universe
into air, land, and water, creating the Middle
Waters. Wakonda brought three groups together,
and they became the Wa-zha-she, the
"Children of the Middle Waters," or the Osage
nation.</p>

<p>The location of the Osage creation is cloaked
in myth and metaphor, but many believe that
they formed as a distinct people in the forests
along the Ohio Valley and were pushed onto
the prairies by Iroquois attacks. Others argue
they were survivors of the Oneota cultural
complex of the Plains river valleys. By 1673 the
Osages were dwelling along the Osage River (in
present-day Missouri), and throughout the
eighteenth century they hunted in the Ozark
Highlands and out onto the Great Plains. They
occupied the region from the Republican River
in Kansas south to the Red River of Oklahoma
and Texas until the early 1830s. In 1839, to make
room for the removed eastern tribes, the Osages
were forced onto a reservation in southern
Kansas. In 1870, as whites invaded their reservation,
they were moved south into Indian Territory.</p>

<p>The Osages were semisedentary people who
inhabited wooden longhouses in prairie villages
in the spring and fall and spent summers
in the Plains and winters in the forest. In the
spring, after planting their crops, they left
their villages to hunt in the Great Plains. In
early July they returned to the villages to harvest
their crops and store them for winter.
They returned to the Plains in September,
where they hunted until winter and then traveled
back to the forests. They remained there
until spring, when they gathered again to renew
their seasonal cycle.</p>

<p>Osage men wore deerskin breechcloths and
covered their legs with buckskin leggings.
They rarely wore anything on their upper
bodies, and only in the winter did they wrap
themselves in buffalo robes. Osage women
wore red and blue dyed buckskin leggings and
buckskin tunics. The Osages became well
known for their silk ribbon reverse appliqu&#233;,
in which they cut silk in elaborate patterns
and sewed them in layers onto their blankets
and clothing.</p>

<p>The Osages believed that all things of the
universe were manifestations of Wakonda.
They sought to live in peace and harmony
with the universe. Clan elders possessed sacred
songs, rituals, and bundles, and they used
them to sanctify important events and solicit
the support of Wakonda.</p>

<p>The basic political unit of the Osages was the
village, and according to Osage oral traditions,
in the beginning all of the Osages lived in a
single village along a river. The village contained
twenty-four clans and was divided into
moieties, the earth people and sky people.
Each moiety had a hereditary leader, and these
two chiefs shared power with clan elders. Together
they made up the village council, which
led the people. For a variety of political, economic,
and social reasons, as the Osages moved
west they separated into three major bands,
with the two northern bands, the Big and Little
Osages, occupying southern Kansas, and the
Arkansas Osages, occupying the Verdigris
River valley, just north of the Three Forks of
the Arkansas.</p>

<p>The Osages were a numerous people. The
earliest account of their population dates to
1719, when Claude-Charles DuTisne estimated
there were 200 warriors and 200 lodges in the
single village he visited. In 1817 superintendent
of Indian Affairs William Clark reported 6,000
Osages. Great epidemics struck the Osages in
the 1830s; hundreds died, as they were simultaneously
stricken with cholera and smallpox.
Later, on their reservation, pneumonia and tuberculosis
continued to take a toll, and their
population fell to 4,000 by 1870. By 1906 they
numbered only 2,000.</p>

<p>In the early twenty-first century, there are
now about 10,000 Osages on the tribal roll,
but due to the unique nature of the Osage
allotment, there are two distinct forms of
membership. Osage lands were allotted individually
in 1906, but because they had purchased
their 1,470,559 acres from the Cherokees
and possessed fee simple title to the land,
the government had to negotiate with them
before they could make more allotments.
While allotting the surface rights individually,
the Osages successfully preserved communal
ownership to the mineral rights to all of their
lands. They retain these today. The mineral
rights were divided equally into 2,229 shares
for the individuals on the roll on July 1, 1907.
These shares&#8211;headrights&#8211;would never be
divided, and subsequently, children born to
Osage parents were recognized as members of
the tribe but were not given additional shares
in the tribe's income. After allotment, their
reservation became Osage County, where 30
percent of Osages live today. Another 30 percent
lives elsewhere in Oklahoma, and the remainder
lives in other parts of the United
States.</p>
