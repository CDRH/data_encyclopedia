<head type="main">PAYIPWAT (ca. 1816-1908)</head>

<p>Payipwat was one of five major chiefs of the
Plains Cree (Nehiyawak) after 1860. He was
born around 1816, probably in what is now
southwestern Manitoba or eastern Saskatchewan,
and named Kisikawasan Awasis, or "Flash
in the Sky Boy." As a child he and his grandmother
were captured and adopted by the
Sioux. At age fourteen he was rescued by his
own people, and he grew up to be a highly
respected spiritual leader among the Young
Dogs, a notable Cree-Assiniboine band of the
Qu'Appelle Valley region. Because he learned
Sioux medicine, his people named him Payipwat
(or Piapot), "Hole in the Sioux," sometimes
translated as "One Who Knows the Secrets
of the Sioux."</p>

<p>An independent and assertive leader, Payipwat
agreed to Treaty Number 4 in 1875, after
making it clear that it was a "preliminary negotiation."
He insisted that the treaty contain
a number of additional provisions, and while
Treaty 4 was never altered, many of these
provisions were written into Treaty Number 6
(1876).</p>

<p>With the disappearance of the bison, Payipwat
and other Plains Cree and Assiniboine
leaders argued for the establishment of a large
Indian territory in the Cypress Hills. However,
the plan was thwarted when the federal government
coerced their removal to smaller reserves
by withholding rations from the starving
Indians. The Plains Native coalition for an
Indian territory collapsed when the government
took advantage of the M&#233;tis resistance
(1885) to crush it.</p>

<p>Once settled on his reserve near Fort Qu'Appelle,
Payipwat continued pressing the federal
government to live up to its treaty promises
and continued resisting government regulations
prohibiting ceremonial practices. Until
the end of his life Payipwat resisted Christian
conversion and challenged Canadian infringements
on Cree sovereignty. A federal order
deposing him as chief of his band was issued
the day he died, in late April of 1908, on the
Piapot Reserve in Saskatchewan.</p>
