<head type="main">AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL MOVEMENT</head>

<p>The American Agriculture Movement (<hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi>)
originated among Great Plains farm men and
women who, in 1977, protested government
farm policy, specifically the 1973 and 1977 farm
bills, that encouraged increased, large-scale
production without corresponding high supports.
An unstructured farmers' organization,
<hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> boldly dramatized the grievances of family
farmers: a depressed farm economy, low
prices, high operating costs, a disinterested
government, and ineffective farm groups.
Central to its goals then and now was the call
for 100 percent of parity for all domestic
and foreign consumer agriculture products.
Achieving higher commodity prices has eluded
<hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi>, as has the ability to sustain momentum,
which diminished with the loss of media
publicity in the early 1980s. Redirecting its
strategy away from the early, naively conceived
demonstrations toward more effective political
lobbying, however, has enabled <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> to
maintain a voice in agricultural policymaking.</p>

<p>At the outset of aam activism, farm men
and women were caught in an ever-tightening
economic vise of surging fixed costs and rising
interest rates. Farming had become increasingly
complex, industrialized, efficient, international,
and productive throughout the century.
The resulting chronic overproduction,
low prices, and greater need for capital
had altered the nature of farm economics as
well, making family farming a vanishing prospect.
<hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi>'s demand for parity referred to an
economic relationship in which strong agricultural
prices boosted farmers' purchasing
power to at least equal that of other sectors of
the economy. Parity has been the baseline for
formulating federal agricultural policy since
the 1920s, when agricultural prosperity was
measured against the prosperous years of 1909
to 1914, otherwise known as the "golden age of
agriculture." After both world wars and until
the early 1970s, the agricultural economy was
relatively stable, with steady interest rates
and prices near 100 percent of parity, aided
by government price supports and production
controls (incidentally designed to eliminate
smaller farms).</p>

<p>Domestic and international developments
beginning in the 1960s, however, presaged the
agricultural downturn of the 1970s against
which <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> would protest. The Agricultural
Act of 1965 reduced the strength of American
commodity prices on international markets.
International crop failures, especially in the
Soviet Union, initially enhanced demand for
American grain; exports more than doubled
between 1968 and 1973, prices jumped, and the
government urged farmers to plant and fertilize
more. Yet conflicts in the Middle East led to
escalating petroleum prices and sharp increases
in gasoline, farm machinery, and
petroleum-based fertilizers. What looked to be
an improving agricultural economy in 1973
was in dissipation in 1976, when international
grain production levels recovered and American
farm prices tumbled. Additionally, the Agricultural
Act of 1977 established a floor on
commodity prices that was well under the
average for 1973 to 1975. Farmers who signed
government contracts would receive a combination
of loans and direct payments toward
a government-determined "target price" that
was notably less than the government's cost of
production figures.</p>

<p>Drastically deteriorating agricultural conditions
provoked voices of dissent, and strike
talk among a small group of Springfield, Colorado,
large-scale wheat farmers and farmrelated
businessmen in September 1977 resonated
widely. Within weeks, 600 farm men
and women gathered in Springfield supporting
the call for a national farm strike by all
food and fiber producers. Organizers set the
strike date as December 14, at which time producers
would cut production levels by 50 percent
if legislators failed to address the deficiencies
of the two recent farm bills and guarantee
100 percent of parity. The group, initially calling
itself the American Agricultural Strike,
overestimated both the importance of the
family farm to the national economy and the
farmers' commitment to the strike. Nevertheless,
the movement effectively used the media,
rallies, "tractorcades," and pamphlets to attract
attention and expand. In October 5,000
farm men and women demonstrated in Amarillo,
Texas, and by year's end, the group, now
calling itself the American Agriculture Movement,
claimed 1,100 local offices in forty states.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi>'s farm strike and political
activism floundered. When asked later, the
vast majority of <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> leaders conceded they
had not adhered to the strike's call to reduce
production. While publicity generated interest
in <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi>'s cause, such as coverage of the
January 18, 1978, assemblage of some 3,000
farm men and women in Washington <hi rend="smallcaps">DC</hi>, it
was also used against them by opponents. A
second gathering of farmers in Washington on
February 5, 1979, damaged credibility when
aam tractors ensnarled traffic and, according
to an unsympathetic Senate, caused $3.6 million
in damages to federal property. Despite
<hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi>'s assistance to the local community during
a blizzard, the negative publicity resulted
in a significant loss of support.</p>

<p>Politically, <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi>'s loose structure and alienation
from major farm groups confused legislators.
Similar to the American Farm Bureau
Federation, <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> relied upon local groups of
farmers for its organization, instead of on
structured leadership. While in Washington,
aam developed state delegations whereby representatives
from each met nightly as the "delegate
body" and by day badgered congressional
staff with demands for 100 percent of parity,
import tariffs, and minimum prices for exports.
<hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> proposals were opposed by the Carter
administration, the Farm Bureau, and
other lobbying groups who predicted runaway
inflation and higher consumer food costs. Despite
winning a moratorium on foreclosures
by the Farmers Home Administration and an
11 percent increase in price supports, <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> believed
it had been sold out. Consequently, it
pursued a more disruptive strategy when it
returned to Washington in February 1979.</p>

<p>By June, between 60 and 90 percent of <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi>
offices had closed, but, unwilling to give up,
the group incorporated in August as <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> Inc.
with Texas cotton farmer Marvin Meek as
chair. Under Meek, <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> Inc. lobbied for
higher commodity prices and the manufacture
of gasohol, but the government remained
unresponsive to the fact that farm prices fell
each month during 1981. In 1982 <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> Inc. supporters
began pressuring state legislatures for
assistance. At this point several factions splintered
off and became Grassroots aam, but
<hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> Inc. remained the larger and more visible
group. <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> Inc. formed a political action
committee and pooled the largest resources of
any farm group in the 1982 elections. It is currently
part of the National Farm Coalition, an
organization dedicated to promoting a unified
farm program. Today, <hi rend="smallcaps">AAM</hi> Inc. also lobbies
for rural issues.</p>
