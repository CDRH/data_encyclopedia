<head type="main">FARMERS ALLIANCE</head>

<p>Widespread economic distress among farmers
in the South and Great Plains in the 1870s and
1880s, resulting from such problems as overproduction,
declining commodity prices, inadequate
credit, and transportation costs,
launched the Farmers Alliance, one of the
most influential agrarian protest movements
in the United States. At one point three distinct
organizations carried the name. The appeal of
one National Farmers Alliance, the "northern"
sibling organized in Chicago in 1880 and led
by farm journalist Milton George, was largely
limited to the Midwest. It was soon overshadowed
by the far larger and more important
National Farmers Alliance that originated in
1877 on the Texas frontier in Lampasas County.
Despite its much greater size and geographical
reach into the Great Plains, especially Kansas,
Colorado, and the Dakotas, as well as to California
and the South, it is commonly labeled
the "southern" Alliance. The third division,
which complemented the latter's evangelical
drive to enlist all southern farmers, was the Colored
Farmers National Alliance, also founded in
Texas, in 1886.</p>

<p>When Charles William Macune, a country
doctor, assumed the leadership of the Texas
Farmers Alliance in 1886, he offered an ambitious
program of economic cooperation
and expansion into a new, nonpartisan national
organization. Within five years, the
"southern" National Farmers Alliance became
the largest citizen organization of nineteen-thcentury
America. When neither the Democratic
nor Republican Party proved responsive
to its demands for agrarian reform, the Alliance
became the leading institutional vehicle
for the organization of the Populist Party
in 1891-92, effectively ending the Alliance's
growth and influence by the late 1890s.</p>
