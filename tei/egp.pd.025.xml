<head type="main">GRANGE</head>

<p>The Order of Patrons of Husbandry, or the
Grange, was the first important large organization
of farmers in the United States. Founded
in 1867, principally by Oliver H. Kelley, a Minnesota
farmer and clerk in the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, the Grange opened its
membership to men and women as a fraternal
organization of rural people and worked to
facilitate better social life for farm families, to
share useful information, and to reduce the
hostility of sectionalism after the Civil War.</p>

<p>The first growth of the organization occurred
in Minnesota, with chapters outside
Minnesota emerging in the early 1870s when
farmers suffered economically. The Depression
of 1873 especially increased membership.
Grangers, as members were called, believed
themselves the victims of railroads, which
charged oppressive transportation rates and
purchased their produce at low prices because of
their monopoly powers, and also of various
middlemen with whom farmers had to do business.
Moreover, farmers in the Great Plains
faced additional problems of bad weather and
insects, especially grasshoppers. In fact, in 1874
Grangers throughout the nation sent money
and supplies to fellow members in the Great
Plains suffering grasshopper infestation.</p>

<p>By 1876, while Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa led
the way with total number of local chapters,
or granges, Nebraska, Kansas, and Montana
had the largest number of members per 1,000
population. Most Grangers eventually became
interested in Grange-owned marketing cooperatives
and farm equipment factories. Additionally,
in an effort to accommodate the
needs of Grangers, the private mail-order firm
of Montgomery Ward and Company was established.
And in the Middle West particularly,
promoting state regulation of railroad
shipping rates became a major concern of
Grangers. However, in Kansas and Nebraska,
railroad regulation generated little interest,
for farmers in still-developing parts of the
Great Plains desired increased trackage, not
expansion-hindering public oversight.</p>

<p>Grangers throughout the nation did agree
on other reform topics, in particular financial
and monetary policy, as well as political reforms.
While the official position of the National
Grange was nonpartisan, advocating issues
but not parties, many Grangers joined
and even assumed leadership roles in emerging political third parties, such as the statelevel
Antimonopoly, Reform, and Greenback
Parties, and also exerted influence in the major
parties. The greatest success of their political
activism was the enactment of state railroad
regulation, commonly known as the
Granger Laws.</p>

<p>By 1880 the Granger movement began to
lose its impetus. Even though the U.S. Supreme
<title>Court in Munn v. Illinois</title> (1877)&#8211;and
in subsequent Granger cases&#8211;upheld the
constitutionality of state railroad laws, many
states repealed their railroad laws in the face of
diminished rail service. The Grangers' marketing
and manufacturing efforts failed, as
they were undersold by competitors. In all, the
number of members of the Grange nationally
had shrunk to about 124,000 from a high of
860,000.</p>

<p>But the Grange did not pass away. During
the decade of the 1870s, farmers in the West
and South had dominated the organization.
Thereafter, northeasterners played a leading
role in reviving the Grange, which nationally
had more than 300,000 members in the 1990s.</p>

<p>Many issues and government programs
promoted by the Grange have been successful.
Over the years Grangers called for women's
suffrage, direct election of U.S. senators, direct
primaries, graduated income tax, rural free
delivery, parcel post system, better country
roads, rural electrification, improved education
for farm children and college students
(especially at land grant institutions), extension
service, federal farm credit programs,
and parity price supports. Today, the National
Grange continues to lobby for farm policies
from its headquarters in Washington <hi rend="smallcaps">DC</hi>.</p>
