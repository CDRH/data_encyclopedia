<head type="main">AUGHEY, SAMUEL, JR. (1831-1912)</head>

<p>Samuel Aughey Jr. was a minister and naturalist/
geologist in Nebraska and Wyoming from
1864 until 1886. He was born on February 8,
1831, near Mi√Ñin, Pennsylvania, the son of
Samuel and Elizabeth Kepner Aughey. He
graduated from Pennsylvania College (now
Gettysburg College) in 1856 and then attended
seminary there. Aughey came to Dakota City,
Nebraska, in 1864 as a "home missionary" for
the Lutheran Church. After resigning this position
in 1867, he worked for the Dakota County
government from 1866 until 1869 as superintendent
of public instruction and county surveyor.
He was named the first professor of natural
science at the University of Nebraska in
Lincoln in 1871.</p>

<p>Despite heavy teaching responsibilities,
Aughey published widely on the geology, botany,
and zoology of Nebraska. The work was
of uneven quality; when scientific information
conflicted with his desire to promote the
Plains as an ideal place for settlers, his promotional
instincts often won. For example, writing
in 1880 during one of Nebraska's wetter
periods, Aughey confidently asserted that the
act of cultivating the soil was responsible for
increased rainfall. This apocryphal theory,
"rainfall follows the plow," did not survive the
devastating drought of the 1890s. Aughey was
also instrumental in the founding of both the
Nebraska State Historical Society and the Nebraska
Academy of Sciences, serving as the
first secretary of the former and the first president
of the latter.</p>

<p>Aughey's relationship with the University of
Nebraska began to deteriorate in the early
1880s. In 1883, he was involved in a financial
scandal that precipitated his resignation from
the university. He subsequently became territorial
geologist for Wyoming. A smelting accident
in 1886 left him with severe heavy metal
poisoning and ended his career as a geologist
and his time as a resident of the Great Plains.</p>

<p>Aughey had married Elizabeth Catherine
Welty on October 14, 1858. They had three
children, only one of whom, Helen Barbara,
survived childhood. Aughey died on February
3, 1912, in Spokane, Washington.</p>
