<p>It should come as no surprise to learn that the
most characteristic birds of the Great Plains
are small, mostly dead-grass brownish, and
inconspicuous; there are few places to hide or
nest in grasslands except among the grasses
themselves. Of all of the native terrestrial birds
in North America north of Mexico, less than
10 percent, or about thirty species, can be considered
as Great Plains endemics. This term
describes those species that are not only native
to a geographic or ecologic region but are also
essentially limited to it.</p>

<p>The 200-plus species of birds that breed within
the Great Plains are of special interest for several
reasons. First, there are those relatively few
grassland endemics that presumably evolved in
a semiarid grass-dominated environment and
consequently have acquired an array of ecologically
adaptive characteristics (ground-nesting,
often seed-eating, with well-camouflaged plumages).
They also have communication systems
(vocalizations and plumage patterns) that are
adaptively modified for effectiveness in openfield
environments, such as singing in flight
rather than from elevated perches. Many have
conspicuous wing, tail, or underpart markings
that are highly visible while flying but are hidden
when on the ground. A dozen species of
sparrows, five shorebirds, three grouse species,
two meadowlarks, the horned lark (<hi rend="italic">Eremophila
alpestris</hi>), and the Sprague's pipit (<hi rend="italic">Anthus
spraguei</hi>) all closely conform to this combination
of traits. A half-dozen predatory birds,
which are often open-country species that may
also range into deserts, also are grassland
adapted. These include the prairie falcon (<hi rend="italic">Falco
mexicanus</hi>), Swainson's and ferruginous hawks
(<hi rend="italic">Buteo swainsoni</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B. regalis</hi>), northern harrier
(<hi rend="italic">Circus cyaneus</hi>), and the short-eared and
burrowing owls (<hi rend="italic">Asio flammea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Athene
cunicularia</hi>), although a few of these are tree- or
cliff-nesters rather than being strictly groundnesting.
Finally, three aquatic species that are
adapted to nesting in prairie marshes, the Wilson's
phalarope (<hi rend="italic">Phalaropus tricolor</hi>), black tern
(<hi rend="italic">Chlidonias niger</hi>), and Franklin's gull (<hi rend="italic">Larus
pipixican</hi>), round out the list of Great Plains
endemics.</p>

<p>The second group of birds having particular
relevance to the Great Plains are those closely
related species occurring in forests both to the
east and west of the Plains, but that are largely
excluded from the Plains grasslands. These
often penetrate and locally cross the Plains
only along those predominately east.west river
systems supporting su.cient woody growth
that provide narrow corridors for the birds to
exploit. In many respects these species are of
even greater biological interest than are the
strictly grassland endemics, because where the
western species encounter the eastern near-relatives,
interactions can occur between them
for the first time since their ancestors were
originally separated. This may have happened
as long ago as when the Great Plains grasslands
originally developed as mountain building to
the west produced increasing aridity eastwardly,
or at least since the last glaciations
had similar isolating effects on the Northern
Plains. It is in such ecological and genetic
"suture zones," such as those provided by the
Platte and Niobrara River valleys in Nebraska,
that these populations come into contact and
variably interact. Examples of such eastern
versus western relatives include the Baltimore
and Bullock's orioles (<hi rend="italic">Icterus galbula</hi> and <hi rend="italic">I.
spurius</hi>), the rose-breasted and black-headed
grosbeaks (<hi rend="italic">Pheuticus ludovicianus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P. melanocephalus</hi>),
the indigo and lazuli buntings
(<hi rend="italic">Passerina cyanea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P. amoena</hi>), and the
eastern and spotted towhees (<hi rend="italic">Pipilo erythropthalmus</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">P. maculatus</hi>). All of these closely
related pairs meet and, to varying degrees,
hybridize along river corridors. The extent to
which such hybridization results provides a
rough index to their genetic disparity and the
duration of separation of their populations.
The most extensively hybridizing species pairs
among the birds mentioned are the towhees
and the orioles, which have broad and extensive
zones of hybridization and have until recently
been considered as subspecies. However,
the grosbeaks and buntings show reduced
levels of hybridization and their species distinctiveness
has rarely been questioned. Yet because
of increased degrees of tree planting
across the Plains and the progressive growth of
riverine forests since the cessation of prairie
fires, the frequency of hybridization opportunities
for such species pairs may continue to
increase.</p>

<p>A third group of birds that nest at least in
parts of the Great Plains are other woodland
birds that do not necessarily have eastern and
western counterparts. Many of these are of
nearly universal occurrence throughout the
forests of North America and have managed
to penetrate the limits of the Great Plains
in various regions. Surprisingly, these treeadapted
birds comprise about half of the total
Plains avifauna, even though woodlands and
forests occupy less than 5 percent of the total
area of the region. These birds include groups
such as woodpeckers, warblers, vireos, and
other mostly insect-eating and tree-foraging
or tree-nesting birds.</p>

<p>Although no Great Plains birds have become
extinct, many grassland-adapted birds
have undergone severe population declines in
recent years as native grasslands have disappeared.
In an analysis of breeding bird populations
based on annual surveys done between
1966 and 1993, only four of twenty-eight monitored
grassland species have shown positive,
statistically significant population trends.
Twenty-one species have exhibited population
declines, many of them statistically significant.</p>
