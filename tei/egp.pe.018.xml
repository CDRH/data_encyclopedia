<head type="main">CHINOOKS</head>

<p>Chinooks are warm and dry winds that descend
the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains
and dramatically affect the cold-season
weather of the western Great Plains. This term
is derived from the Chinook Indians of Oregon,
who originally identified a local unseasonably
warm wind as a "snow-eater." Air
from a mild source region over the Pacific
Ocean is further warmed by compression as it
descends downslope and replaces a shallow
cold air mass. Chinooks are capable of warming
regions near the mountains by 50&#186;F to
68\F in time periods as brief as fifteen minutes,
leading to a rapid melting of any snow
cover that is present. Some of the greatest extremes
of temperature change in U.S. history
have occurred in the Great Plains due to chinooks,
including a warming of 81&#186;F in two
minutes in Spearfish, South Dakota, on January
22, 1943.</p>

<p>While chinooks have beneficial temperature
effects during the cold season, they may
also be accompanied by severe windstorms,
especially east of the Front Range of the Colorado
Rockies. A stable layer in the atmosphere
just above the mountains and a low-pressure
trough to the east of the mountains cause
westerly winds to accelerate over the Front
Range. In this situation, a mountain wave can
develop that forces the air above the mountain
upward followed by a severe downslope acceleration.
In one instance, a chinook windstorm
struck Boulder, Colorado, on January 17, 1982,
with winds in excess of 200 feet per second,
resulting in more than $17 million in damage.</p>
