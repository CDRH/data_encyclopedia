<head type="main">COTTONWOODS</head>

<p>Cottonwoods, tall and stately pioneer invaders
of the prairies&#8211;though few and far between
when European Americans first came to the
Great Plains&#8211;served as prominent landmarks
and shady respites for those who traversed the
region. They often marked a source of water
and provided fuel for campsites. The cottonwood
population increased dramatically with
the coming of the plow and the demise of
prairie wildfires. The seedlings that sprouted
on sandbars were collected by early settlers
and planted at their homesites for shade and
wind shelter.</p>

<p>Today, cottonwoods continue to be an important
part of farmstead windbreaks and
field shelterbelts. Natural cottonwood stands
are one of the main sources of sawtimber harvested
in the Great Plains. The lumber, though
lightweight and soft, is used for pallets and
light construction. These fast growing, easily
propagated trees are also used to provide fiber
for high-quality paper.</p>

<p>Cottonwoods&#8211;members of the genus Populus
in the willow family (Salicaceae)&#8211;are
most at home along flowing streams and level,
subirrigated uplands where soil moisture is
plentiful. They bear wind-pollinated flowers.
After pollination capsules release large numbers
of tiny, cottony, winged seeds in early
summer that must germinate and take root in
a matter of hours or perish because they do
not contain their own built-in food supply.
Most species of <hi rend="italic">Populus</hi> will also reproduce
readily by stump and root sprouts. They can
be propagated by hardwood cuttings as well.</p>

<p>Eastern cottonwood (<hi rend="italic">P. deltoides</hi>) and its
western variety plains cottonwood (<hi rend="italic">var. occidentalis</hi>)
grow throughout the Great Plains
from the Rio Grande to the Prairie Provinces
of Canada. The national cochampion eastern
cottonwood stood ninety-six feet tall near
Arapahoe, Nebraska, until it was severely
damaged by wind. The national champion
plains cottonwood stands 105 feet tall near
Hygiene, Colorado.</p>

<p>Other cottonwood species native to the
Great Plains are the narrowleaf cottonwood
(<hi rend="italic">P. anqustifolia</hi>) and the lanceleaf cottonwood
(<hi rend="italic">p. xacuminata</hi>), which is believed to be a natural
cross between the eastern and narrowleaf
cottonwoods. Closely related family members
&#8211;balsam poplar (<hi rend="italic">P. balsamifera</hi>) and quaking
aspen (<hi rend="italic">P. tremuloides</hi>)&#8211;are natives of northern
portions of the Great Plains.</p>
