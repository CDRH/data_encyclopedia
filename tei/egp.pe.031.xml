<p>Grasshoppers inhabit all grasslands and associated
arid regions in the Great Plains, where they
eat a varied diet of grasses or herbs. Among
native herbivores, grasshoppers rank among the
most conspicuous and important consumers of
aboveground vegetation in natural grasslands,
often rivaling large vertebrate ungulates in impact.
The species diversity of grasshoppers is
great, with about 750 species found throughout
North America and about 400 species inhabiting
the seventeen western states. These numbers
are similar to bird species diversity. Taxonomically,
grasshoppers in the Great Plains are divided
into four main groups or subfamilies:
Gomphocerines (slant-faced grasshoppers),
Oedipodines (band-winged grasshoppers),
Melanoplines (spur-throat grasshoppers), and
Cyrtacanthacradines. These groupings reflect
historical, evolutionary trajectories that loosely
predict diet, reproductive characteristics,
and habitat use. Migratory locusts, a form of
grasshopper, are not found in North America
although they do occur in Central America,
and the term has been repeatedly misused
in popular accounts describing grasshopper
outbreaks.</p>

<p>Given the great number of grasshopper species
in the Great Plains, it is not surprising that
species react to common environmental factors
in different ways, with obvious species-specific
differences in plant species eaten, courtship behavior, habitat selection, and geographic distribution.
Unlike butterflies or leafhoppers,
grasshoppers do not specialize on particular
host plants, although they are discriminating
feeders and will not feed on just anything.
Grasshopper assemblies change in species
composition along environmental gradients,
just as plant communities vary, often in a
gradual manner.</p>

<p>Grasshoppers occur year-round at all sites,
primarily as eggs or overwintering nymphs
during cold months and nymphs or reproductive
adults at other times. Seasonal appearances
of nymphs and adults of different species
result in distinct groups of one-generation-
per-year spring and summer species
complexes in the Central and Northern
Great Plains, and species with extended seasonality
or even multiple generations per year
populate the Southern Great Plains.</p>

<p>Densities rarely become so great that vegetation
of entire regions is denuded with great
impact on native plants as well as crops. In
most years, however, grasshoppers consume
less than 10 percent of the standing vegetation
in grasslands. Rocky mountain locusts (<hi rend="italic">Melanoplus
spretus</hi> Walsh) presented a spectacular
example of grasshopper outbreaks during the
midâ€“ and late nineteenth century, when millions
of individuals dispersed from central
breeding grounds in the shortgrass prairies of
Colorado into neighboring eastern states,
causing significant crop damage. A particularly
vivid portrayal of such an infestation is
given in the novel <title>Giants in the Earth</title> (1927),
O. E. R&#246;lvaag's vivid saga of pioneer settlement
in South Dakota in the 1870s. This species
is now presumed extinct for unknown
reasons, probably resulting from agricultural
development in shortgrass prairie regions.</p>

<p>Grasshopper populations are quite dynamic,
with periodic fluctuations in overall numbers
for all species about every seven to ten years.
Climate and food quality can play important
roles in these changes, but many other ecological
factors are also involved, including competition
for limited food resources. Predators and
other natural enemies&#8211;primarily birds, spiders, other insect predators, and insect parasites
&#8211;also exert significant limiting effects on population
sizes; pathogens, including bacteria, viruses,
and fungi, can also kill many grasshoppers
in some years.</p>
