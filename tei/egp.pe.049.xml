<head type="main">PRAIRIE PRESERVATION</head>

<p>Prairie preservation in both the United States
and Canada began under the aegis of the national
governments. In Canada efforts began
in the second decade of the twentieth century
when the parks branch of the Department of
Interior sought suitable prairie habitat for restoring
pronghorn antelope populations. Three
reserves became dominion parks in 1922&#8211;
Nemiskam, Wawaskesy, and Menissawok&#8211;and
all subsequently were ceded to the Provinces of
Alberta and Saskatchewan during the 1930s and
1940s. Initial U.S. efforts were a reaction to the
Dust Bowl. Under the 1934 Bankhead-Jones
Farm Tenant Act, the federal government acquired
11.3 million acres of submarginal farmland.
Of this, 2.64 million acres in the Great
Plains were eventually designated as national
grasslands.</p>

<p>Organized efforts to preserve prairies date
to the 1930s in the United States, when the
Ecological Society of America and the National
Research Council began advocating the
inclusion of a prairie area in the national park
system. During the 1950s, the National Park
Service began to investigate sites in Kansas.
The combined efforts of several environmental
groups, the National Park Service, and key
Kansas legislators finally succeeded in creating
a 10,894-acre preserve in the Flint Hills, officially
designated as the National Tallgrass
Prairie Preserve in 1996. In Canada, the Saskatchewan
Natural History Society began lobbying
for a prairie national park in the late
1950s. This effort eventually materialized in
the Grasslands National Park in Alberta, established
1981.</p>

<p>Among organizations The Nature Conservancy
has most aggressively pursued prairie
preservation, thanks in large part to the philanthropy
of the late Katherine Ordway (1899.
1979). As of the mid-1990s The Nature Conservancy
had acquired more than 550,000 acres of
grasslands in the Great Plains, the largest preserves
being Cross Ranch, North Dakota; Samuel
H. Ordway Jr. Memorial Prairie, South Dakota;
Konza Prairie, Kansas; Tallgrass Prairie
Preserve, Oklahoma; and Niobrara Valley Preserve,
Nebraska. Although not as visible, the
efforts of many smaller organizations are also
noteworthy. Such groups target relatively small,
diverse, and often isolated prairie remnants.
Preserves range from the 26.5-acre St. James
Living Prairie Museum in metropolitan Winnipeg,
Manitoba, to the 1,114-acre Maddin
Ranch near Colorado City, Texas, where the
owner, the Native Prairies Association of Texas,
is working with the Natural Resources Conservation
Service to restore the prairie ecosystem.</p>

<p>Promising, but as yet unproven, efforts are
the public-private partnerships that have proliferated
since the late 1980s. These partnerships
include the North American Waterfowl
Management Plan, signed by Canada and the
United States in 1986, which gave rise to the
Prairie Pothole Joint Venture and the Prairie
Habitat Joint Venture. The Great Plains Partnership,
initiated by the Western Governors
Association, has attempted to coordinate ongoing
scientific research and data collection
with conservation activities. The Prairie Conservation
Act Plan (1989-1995), a product of
the World Wildlife Fund and the governments
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, led
to a variety of initiatives as well as actual land
reserves. More recently, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service initiated the Sandhills Management
Plan. Although such partnerships
may substantially reform land-management
practices throughout the Great Plains, the
long-term potential for large-scale prairie restoration
remains an open question.</p>
