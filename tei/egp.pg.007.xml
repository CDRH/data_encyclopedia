<p>William Jennings Bryan, known as the "Boy
Orator of the Platte" and the "Great Commoner,"
was a political leader with uncommon
oratorical abilities and an affinity for the
religious and rural classes. Born on March 19,
1860, in Salem, Illinois, Bryan idolized Abraham
Lincoln, who had been born nearby. In
Lincoln, Bryan saw a public servant with a
strong dedication to the common people and
a strong faith in Christian morality. Bryan
adopted both.</p>

<p>Bryan attended Illinois College, where he
met his wife, Mary Baird, and graduated from
Chicago's Union College of Law in 1883. In
1887 he relocated to Lincoln, Nebraska, which
would be his home until 1921. He established a
law office with his friend Adolphus R. Talbot
and practiced until 1895, while establishing
himself politically among Nebraska's Democratic
leadership. Less business-oriented than
other Nebraska Democrats, such as J. Sterling
Morton, Bryan was chosen to run in the 1890
congressional elections to appeal to the increasingly
political Farmers Alliance, which
would evolve into the Populist, or People's,
Party. Although traditionally a Republican
state, Nebraska elected Bryan to his first political
office. He served in the House of Representatives
from 1891 to 1895. From 1894 to 1896
he also edited the Democratic <title level="j">Omaha World-
Herald</title>.</p>

<p>In 1896 Bryan addressed the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago, giving his
famous "Cross of Gold" speech, a stirring distillation
of the complaints of agrarian and urban
people who felt defeated by America's
rapid industrialization and entry into world
markets. The electrifying speech won Bryan
the presidential nomination at age thirty-six.
Shortly thereafter, the Populist Party also
nominated Bryan but attempted to maintain
its independence by nominating a different
vice presidential candidate. During his campaign
Bryan virtually ignored the Populist
Party, although he did champion its ideas,
chief among them the remonetization of silver.
In part due to fears of political and economic
disruption, William McKinley won the
election, but Bryan would now be the perennial
Democratic presidential candidate.</p>

<p>In 1898 Bryan organized a regiment to fight
in the Spanish-American War, but he remained
in Florida while the unit went on.
Bryan won the Democratic nomination for
the presidency again in 1900; his campaign
attacked America's imperial role following the
Spanish-American and Philippine-American
wars. American voters rejected Bryan's antiimperialism
and reelected McKinley by an
even larger margin than in 1896. In 1901 Bryan
established <title level="j">The Commoner</title>, which advanced
his liberal political views and conservative religious
beliefs.</p>

<p>Bryan received the Democratic presidential
nomination a third time in 1908 but lost to
Teddy Roosevelt's chosen successor, William
Howard Taft. From 1913 to 1915 Bryan served as
the secretary of state under President Woodrow
Wilson. He resigned in 1915 because he believed
that, despite Wilson's professed neutrality
toward the belligerent powers in World
War I, his pro-British actions would lead America
into war. Although Bryan never won the
presidency, his influence was immense. He traveled
throughout the country and the world
speaking to great crowds on various social and
political issues, including prohibition and women's
suffrage (both of which he supported).</p>

<p>Bryan lived in Lincoln until 1921, when he
moved to Florida. In the last decade of his life
his religious conservatism overshadowed his
liberal political beliefs. His final public appearance
was in Dayton, Tennessee, as prosecuting
lawyer in the trial of John Scopes, who
had been charged with violating a Tennessee
law prohibiting the teaching of the theory of
evolution in the public schools. The opposing
counsel, Clarence Darrow, criticized Bryan's
literal interpretation of the Bible, upon which
the Tennessee law relied, and placed Bryan on
the stand, forcing him to admit to several biblical
contradictions. The state won the case,
but Bryan's own often self-contradictory testimony
highlighted the growing gap between
religious fundamentalism and secularism in
the United States.</p>

<p>William Jennings Bryan died on July 26,
1925, in Dayton, Tennessee, just days after
the Scopes trial. When Bryan championed the
cause of the poor rural and urban classes in
1896, he was seen as a radical voice calling for
deep societal change, but by 1925 his was a
conservative voice. By the close of his life he
had come to symbolize American divisions regarding
religion. Some found in him a perfect
champion of religious conservatism, while
others, such as H. L. Mencken, found him to
represent intolerant religious extremism. Always
controversial, Bryan's career saw his
transformation from a crusader for the rights
of the common people against organized
wealth to an anti-imperialist and, finally, to a
proponent of biblical creationism.</p>
