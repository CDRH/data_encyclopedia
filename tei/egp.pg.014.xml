<head type="main">COOPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH FEDERATION</head>

<p>The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation
(<hi rend="smallcaps">CCF</hi>) was established in 1932 in Calgary, Alberta,
as a socialist coalition of farmers, laborers,
and progressive reformers from western
Canada. The institutional impetus for a
new political party came from the breakaway
"Ginger Group" of Progressive members of
Parliament (<hi rend="smallcaps">MPS</hi>) in cooperation with two Labor
mps, including James Shaver Woodsworth,
who became the party's first federal
leader.</p>

<p>The League for Social Reconstruction, a
group of urban intellectuals, drafted the Regina
Manifesto that the <hi rend="smallcaps">CCF</hi> adopted in 1933.
The manifesto called for the replacement of
capitalism with economic planning, the nationalization
of key industries, and the development
of cooperatives. Though radical, the
socialism of the ccf was nonrevolutionary&#8211;
most of the party's members were not Marxists
but Christian socialists and British Fabians.</p>

<p>Contesting elections federally and provincially,
the <hi rend="smallcaps">CCF</hi> had its greatest successes in the
1940s: it topped a national public opinion poll
in 1943; formed the Official Opposition in Ontario
in the same year; formed a government
led by Tommy C. Douglas in Saskatchewan in
1944; and elected twenty-eight <hi rend="smallcaps">MPS</hi> in 1945. Its
members were adept parliamentarians and innovators
of social policy who pushed the federal
Liberal government to expand and improve
the welfare state in Canada.</p>

<p>With the onset of the cold war, charges of
communism dogged the <hi rend="smallcaps">CCF</hi>. It tried to moderate
its image in 1956 by replacing the Regina
Manifesto with the Winnipeg Declaration, but
was unsuccessful. In the 1958 federal election,
the party's leader, M. J. Coldwell, lost his seat
and the <hi rend="smallcaps">CCF</hi> was reduced to only eight <hi rend="smallcaps">MPS</hi>.
The <hi rend="smallcaps">CCF</hi> and the Canadian Labour Congress
entered a formal alliance to create the New
Democratic Party in 1961.</p>
