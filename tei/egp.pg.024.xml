<head type="main">FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, UNITED STATES</head>

<p>The role of the U.S. federal government in the
development and current status of the Great
Plains has been central and often controversial.
Most of the Great Plains became part of
the United States when the federal government,
led by President Thomas Jefferson,
bought "Louisiana" from the French in 1803.
That same government then commissioned
an expeditionary party to explore the massive
tract of land. The records of Lewis and Clark
constitute the first and, in many ways, the
most influential systematic American observations
and reflections in the Great Plains.</p>

<p>The land of the Great Plains began its relationship
with the federal government as a set
of territories, which meant that governmental
structures were relatively undeveloped and the
federal government, by default, was the crucial
player in the few tasks accorded it in those
days (law enforcement, mail delivery, development
of transportation, and the like). As each
territory acquired more population and identity,
pressure would grow for the territory to
be upgraded to statehood. Thus, Texas became
a state in 1845, Kansas in 1861, Nebraska
in 1867, Colorado in 1876, the Dakotas and
Montana in 1889, Wyoming in 1890, Oklahoma
in 1907, and New Mexico in 1912.</p>

<p>Statehood brought the Great Plains into a
different stage of relationship with the federal
government. Theoretically, such designation
might have been expected to give the states
greater autonomy, but in reality it has not
worked out that way. The shifting nature of
federalism through the history of the Republic
has generally been one of expanding federal
authority. The Civil War, various Supreme
Court decisions, the New Deal, and the Great
Society all shifted power to Washington and
away from the state capitals.</p>

<p>Though affecting the entire country, the expanding
role of the federal government has
probably been resented more in the Great
Plains than in any other region except the
South. The spirit of individualism may have
been romanticized in portrayals of the Old
West, but it is not entirely fictitious. Although
historically beneficiaries of federal programs
beyond their proportion in the U.S. population,
citizens of the Great Plains have long been
among the loudest complainers about the goings-
on in far-off Washington. People residing
in the Great Plains still prefer to govern themselves.
Current governors of the states of the
Great Plains stridently object to the "unfunded
mandates" coming from Washington, gun
owners decry federal efforts to control guns,
farmers drive their tractors to Washington to
protest federal policies, antigovernment militias
sprout, and distrust of government and
bureaucrats is rampant and occasionally transforms
into hatred and violence&#8211;witness the
bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma
City and the events following a federal raid on
firearms at the Branch Davidian compound
near Waco.</p>

<p>The federal government's relationship with
Native Americans, many of whom still reside
in the Great Plains, has been checkered and
inconsistent. At different times it has included
breaking legal treaties, forcing people to live
in undesirable areas, promoting assimilation
with whites, protecting cultural differences,
declaring individuals to be wards of the state,
and permitting legalized gaming (and therefore
substantial profits) on land controlled by
Native Americans.</p>

<p>The independent spirit that characterizes
people of the Great Plains, regardless of race
and ethnicity, makes it unlikely any governmental
entity will be embraced warmly. Yet
the U.S. federal government, for better or for
worse, continues to be intimately involved in
the daily lives of people in the Great Plains,
whether by providing farm subsidies, assisting
the elderly, protecting lightly used air traffic
corridors, offering disaster relief, or determining
winners and losers in water disputes.</p>
