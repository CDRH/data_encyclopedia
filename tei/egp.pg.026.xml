<head type="main">FORD, GERALD (b. 1913)</head>

<p>Gerald Ford, the thirty-seventh president of
the United States, was born Leslie Lynch King
in Omaha, Nebraska, on July 14, 1913. However,
he only lived there for seven weeks. To
escape a husband who beat and threatened to
kill her, King's mother fled from Omaha to
her waiting parents across the state line in
Council Bluffs, Iowa. From there, she took her
son back to her childhood home in Grand
Rapids, Michigan. She eventually married a
local paint and varnish dealer, who gave the
boy his name&#8211;Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr.</p>

<p>Thus, despite the fact that Ford shares with
Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson
the distinction of being one of only three
American presidents born in Great Plains
states, Ford's Nebraska roots were not deep.
His youth was spent in Grand Rapids and his
collegiate years at the University of Michigan,
where he excelled in football, and at Yale University,
where he took his law degree. After a
stint in the U.S. Navy during World War II,
Ford was elected to the House of Representatives
from Michigan's Fifth District in 1948. He
served twenty-five years in the House, nine of
them as minority leader, before being tapped
by Richard Nixon in 1973 as his choice to succeed
Spiro Agnew, who had resigned the vice
presidency under a cloud of controversy. Ford
acceded to the presidency on August 9, 1974,
when Nixon himself resigned amid a spate of
Watergate-related charges.</p>

<p>Ford's administration centered around political
crises caused largely by his pardon of
Nixon, a worsening economy, and a break with
the conservative wing of his own Republican
Party. It was the latter concern that fed into an
issue of great importance to American farmers,
particularly wheat farmers in the Great
Plains. On September 9, 1975, Ford suspended
the sale of American grain to the Soviet Union.
Ford argued that his decision was an attempt to
force a Soviet commitment to buy more wheat;
however, many observers concluded that the
decision was an attempt to initiate a "get
tough" policy toward the Soviets in an effort to
shore up his worsening relations with the Republican
Right before the 1976 presidential
election. In either event, Plains farmers were
outraged. Recognizing the possibility for serious
political fallout, by the end of that month
Ford had negotiated a deal with the Soviet
Union that allowed for the increased purchase
of American grain and the lifting of the embargo.
Satisfied with Ford's efforts&#8211;as well as
with his decision to jettison his eastern liberal
vice president, Nelson Rockefeller, in favor of
Kansas senator Bob Dole&#8211;each state of the
Great Plains, save Texas, gave a majority of
their votes to Ford that fall. It was not enough,
however, to save Ford's presidency, as he narrowly
lost his bid for reelection to former
Georgia governor Jimmy Carter.</p>

<p>Following his defeat, Ford returned to the
University of Michigan for a brief tenure as a
professor. He then joined several corporate
boards and charitable organizations. He
briefly entertained a return to politics in 1980
as Ronald Reagan's running mate, but the deal
fell through. Out of politics, Ford presently
divides his time between homes in California
and Colorado.</p>
