<head type="main">HOGG, JAMES (1851-1906)</head>

<p>James Stephen Hogg, born near Rusk, Texas,
on March 24, 1851, served Texas as attorney
general from 1887 to 1890 and as governor
from 1891 to 1895. Walter Prescott Webb described
the "People's Governor" as having
"the courage of leadership which is part of the
Western tradition."</p>

<p>Hogg's influence on the modernization of
the Great Plains was a "rough wooing." Hogg,
himself a small cattleman, favored the open
range over fencing. Perhaps remembering his
father's support for homestead exemption
during the Texas Republic, Hogg supported
protection of homesteads and public school
lands. He recovered much acreage from the
railroads that had been granted for switches
and sidings, but he lost a disputed border area,
Greer County, to Oklahoma. In the Scottish
tradition of being "agin' the government," he
opposed federal crop subsidies. His campaign
slogan was "Enforce the law," whether in dealing
with two-bit outlawry or corporate robbery.
He dissolved the Texas Tra.c Association,
a combination of railroads that sought to
fix rates, and he established the Texas Railroad
Commission for railroad regulation. Hogg's
regulatory program reflected moderate progressivism.
Symbolically, when the railways
shunted Coxey's Army of unemployed protesters
near Sierra Blanca, Texas, in 1894, Hogg
ordered them transported across the state. Although
politically based in East Texas, in 1892
Hogg carried a number of Great Plains counties
despite opposition from Populists and
ranchers. Hogg's administration brought the
maverick Plains, fit to be branded, into the
twentieth century. Hogg died at Houston on
March 3, 1906, and was buried in Austin.</p>
