<head type="main">MORTON, J. STERLING (1832-1902)</head>

<p>Born in Adams, New York, on April 22, 1832,
Morton grew up in Monroe, Michigan, and
was educated at the University of Michigan.
He migrated to Bellevue, Nebraska Territory,
in 1854 and served as clerk of the Nebraska
Supreme Court. In 1855 he became editor of
the <title level="j">Nebraska City News</title> and was twice elected
to the legislature. Morton, a Democrat, was
secretary of the territory from 1858 to 1861,
and was briefly acting governor.</p>

<p>The Civil War brought an era of Republican
domination and political defeats for Morton,
who came to concentrate upon his newspaper
work. He championed rural development,
emphasizing tree planting on the prairies, and
made his Nebraska City farm a place for forestation
and agricultural innovations. Upon
his initiative, the state board of agriculture in
1872 established Arbor Day as an occasion for
planting trees. In time, Arbor Day would be
widely observed. In 1886 Morton, mindful of
environmental change, urged the Nebraska
State Historical Society to create an "arboreal
bureau" which would compile information on
orchard and forestation projects. A "biography
of all the planted trees in the state," he
said, would "lift into view valuable facts and
render humanity a vast service."</p>

<p>A libertarian, Morton opposed railroad
regulation, protective tariffs, and prohibition.
As secretary of agriculture in Grover Cleveland's
second administration, he stressed frugality
and civil service while the scientific
and marketing functions of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture grew. In the monetary
struggle of the 1890s, he backed the gold standard
but failed to prevent William Jennings
Bryan from committing the Democratic Party
to free silver.</p>

<p>Morton later established <title level="j">The Conservative</title>,
a newspaper that heralded his political perspective.
Although Nebraska would gain renown
for conservative Republicanism, no one
better exemplified this conservative heritage
than Democrat J. Sterling Morton. However,
his environmentalism was his more prominent
legacy. He died at the home of his son in
Lake Forest, Illinois, on April 27, 1902.</p>
