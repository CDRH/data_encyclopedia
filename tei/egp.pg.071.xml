<head type="main">ROSS, NELLIE TAYLOE (1876-1977)</head>

<p>Nellie Tayloe Ross is notable as the nation's
first woman governor. She was born in St.
Joseph, Missouri, on November 29, 1876, educated
in private schools, and taught kindergarten
briefly in Omaha, Nebraska. She married
a young lawyer from Tennessee named
William Bradford Ross in 1902, and the couple
moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming. William's law
practice in Cheyenne was very successful, and
he became one of the leaders of the Democratic
Party in Wyoming and was elected governor
in 1922. Nellie spent those years as a wife
and a mother.</p>

<p>Nellie Ross entered into politics with the
death of her husband in 1924. Because William
had completed only the first two years of his
term as governor, a special election was called
to elect a replacement. The Democratic Party
chose Nellie as their candidate and she won
easily. She was known as a good administrator
and a fine public speaker, but she had to work
with a Republican-controlled legislature,
which limited her achievements. She failed to
win reelection by a very narrow margin in
1926.</p>

<p>After her defeat Ross focused on national
politics. She campaigned for presidential candidate
Al Smith in 1928 and became vice chairman
of the Democratic Party. In 1932 she directed
the campaign for the women's vote for
Franklin D. Roosevelt, and because of her
work, President Roosevelt appointed her director
of the U.S. Mint in 1933. She was the
first woman to hold that position, and she
served four five-year terms before retiring
from the U.S. Mint and politics in 1952.</p>

<p>Ross spent the remainder of her life traveling,
lecturing, writing, and with family. She
died in Washington <hi rend="smallcaps">DC</hi> on December 19, 1977,
at the age of 101.</p>
