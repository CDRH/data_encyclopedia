<head type="main">CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS</head>

<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, commonly referred to as the Mormons
or Latter-day Saints, had a significant influence
on the settling of the trans-Mississippi West. In
the spring of 1820 the church's founder, Joseph
Smith Jr., claimed to have received a visitation
by God and Jesus Christ in upstate New York.
In 1823, Smith asserted, the angel Moroni revealed
to him the location of golden plates
recounting the resurrected Christ's appearance
to peoples in the Western Hemisphere. In
1827 Smith acquired these plates and began
translating them into the Book of Mormon, a
companion scripture to the Bible.</p>

<p>On April 6, 1830, Smith and several followers
founded the Church of Latter-day Saints in Fayette,
Seneca County, New York. Missionary labors
commenced, meeting with significant success
at home and abroad. Others, however,
greeted the Latter-day Saints and their prophet
with skepticism at best and persecution at worst.
The Saints sought a more tolerant place to practice
their religion and migrated, first to Kirtland,
Ohio, and then to various settlements in Missouri.
Persecution mounted and mobs forcibly
drove the Saints to Nauvoo, Illinois. On June 27,
1844, violence erupted, and a local militia murdered
Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum in
Carthage, Illinois.</p>

<p>Persecution intensified, and in 1846 the
Saints were driven from Nauvoo. Smith's successor,
Brigham Young, and the majority of the
Latter-day Saints began the exodus west to
Kanesville (Council Bluffs, Iowa) and Winter
Quarters (Florence, Nebraska). The following
year, a portion of those who had temporarily
settled on the Missouri River continued west
along the north side of the Platte to Salt Lake
City, Utah. From 1847 to 1869 more than
70,000 Mormons migrated across the Plains to
the Great Basin. During 1846-47 a Mormon
battalion of 549 men, sixty women, and several
children volunteers served under Gen. Stephen
W. Kearny during the Mexican War. They
marched 1,850 miles from Council Bluffs,
Iowa, in a southwesterly direction across the
Great Plains through Santa Fe to San Diego,
California, in perhaps the longest infantry
march in American history.</p>

<p>Initially, the Mormons viewed the Great
Plains as a barrier to cross in order to reach
their "Zion" in the Great Basin. They established
temporary settlements, freight stations,
ferry crossings, and a Perpetual Emigrating
Fund to assist overland emigrants. Although
they made their headquarters in Salt Lake
City, they also founded more than 400 settlements
from Canada to Mexico and from the
Pacific to the Great Plains. Initial settlement in
the Great Plains took place in the western portions
of Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and
Wyoming. By 1895 Mormon settlement of
southern Alberta made it the first stake (a
group of five to eight wards and branches)
organized outside the United States. Today,
every major city in the Great Plains has at least
one congregation.</p>

<p>Although the Latter-day Saints are America's
fifth-largest church, the majority of adherents
now live outside North America. In
2000 membership exceeded 11 million and was
growing by approximately 400,000 annually.
In the Great Plains states and Prairie Provinces,
membership exceeded 600,000, with more
than 50,000 members each in Alberta, New
Mexico, and Wyoming, 100,000 in Colorado,
and 200,000 in Texas. Of the church's 100 or
more temples, twelve lie within or near the
Great Plains: in Albuquerque, New Mexico;
Billings, Montana; Bismarck, North Dakota;
Cardston, Alberta; Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado;
Edmonton, Alberta; Houston, Texas;
Lubbock, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
Regina, Saskatchewan; and Omaha (Winter
Quarters), Nebraska.</p>
