<head type="main">INDIAN MISSIONARIES</head>

<p>Christian missionaries promoted strategies to
transform Native American communities in
the Great Plains. By the end of the nineteenth
century few reservations and reserves claimed
no Protestant or Catholic presence. Over time,
tribal members selectively accepted certain
cultural components while actively preserving
Native traditions. Intercultural relations involved
individuals acting within dozens of
tribal and denominational traditions, not conflicts
between monolithic "Indian" or "missionary"
perspectives.</p>

<p>Missionary contact with Great Plains tribes
increased during the nineteenth century. Organized
in 1810, the interdenominational American
Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions
(<hi rend="smallcaps">ABCFM</hi>) led the way among Protestant
missionary organizations. In 1819 Congress established
a "civilization fund," appropriating
$10,000 annually to support assimilation programs
for Native Americans. Missionaries, spiritually
motivated by the Second Great Awakening
of the 1820s and 1830s and partially supported
by federal funds, flocked to Indian
Country. When Congress passed the Indian
Removal Act (1830) and forcibly relocated
many eastern tribes to the Plains, Christian
representatives followed close behind to minister
to relocated tribes as well as to Indians. In
1838 Baptist missionary Evan Jones and Cherokee
minister Jesse Bushyhead led two of the
Cherokee removal parties to Indian Territory.</p>

<p>Missionaries exerted little influence over
tribal members during early interactions. In
fact, Christian ministers often lived on the
hospitality of tribal leaders. In 1834 <hi rend="smallcaps">ABCFM</hi>-sponsored
ministers Samuel Allis and John
Dunbar joined the Pawnees during their winter
buffalo hunt in the Central Plains. During
this five-month journey the missionaries lived
beholden to tribal members for linguistic and
cultural education, as well as for food and
shelter. They developed a better understanding
of Pawnee ways during the next few years,
but claimed no conversions. Pawnee leaders
showed interest in the missionaries but ignored
their appeals to abandon their semi-nomadic
lifestyle.</p>

<p>Nineteenth-century missionaries arrived in
the Great Plains with little experience in intercultural
relations. Religious emissaries were
drawn from Roman Catholic, Methodist, Baptist,
Presbyterian, Lutheran, Mormon, Episcopal,
Quaker, and other denominations. Many
had extensive educational backgrounds by
nineteenth-century standards. In the Plains
they endured harsh weather, epidemics, limited
support, and cultural isolation. They
proved incapable, however, of recognizing the
vitality of Native American societies. Instead,
their culturally tainted vision saw tribal members
as "lazy," "childlike," and "corrupt" members
of "offensive" cultural traditions. Some
missionaries disagreed on whether they should
first promote Christianity or "civilization"
within tribal communities. None questioned
the premise of advocating both. Many, including
Rev. John West, an Anglican stationed in
southern Manitoba during the 1820s, considered
principles of Christian mission work as
indistinguishable from civilization programs.</p>

<p>Despite ethnocentric biases, religious leaders
advocated the potential equality of all Christians.
Missionaries provided tribes with support
for their bodies and minds while hoping to cultivate
Christian souls. Jotham Meeker served the
Ottawas in Franklin County, Kansas, for more
than twenty years as a physician and Baptist
minister. Isabel Crawford taught domestic skills
at a remote Kiowa camp in western Oklahoma
during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Catholic sisterhoods, including the
Grey Nuns, Sisters of the Presentation, Benedictines,
and Franciscans, taught in mission
schools and developed health-care facilities.</p>

<p>Missionaries found no single assimilation
formula that would work for all Native Americans.
The effectiveness of programs varied
even within divisions of the same tribe. Distinctive
tribal histories and missionaries' personalities
produced different outcomes at
each mission station. Historic contacts with
European Americans, community locations,
tribal leadership structures, and other variables
influenced tribal acceptance, or rejection,
of the Christian agenda. Missionary flexibility,
communication skills, and attitudes
affected tribal responses. In the 1830s, Jesuits
recognized a failed mission to the Potawatomis
in Council Bluffs, Iowa, at the same time
that they recorded success with Potawatomis
at Sugar Creek, Kansas. Similarly, during the
1870s, Quaker representatives had varying
success with their efforts among the Pawnees,
Otoe-Missourias, and Omahas of Nebraska.</p>

<p>Missionaries did not always practice truly
Christian behavior. President Ulysses Grant's
"Peace Policy" (1869) restricted reservations
to a single Christian denomination, reinforcing
denominational competition for tribal
support. Self-serving actions often came at the
expense of tribal interests. During the 1860s,
Baptist leaders colluded with federal agents to
defraud Ottawas of thousands of acres of their
east-central Kansas land under the guise of
creating an Indian university. Despite varied
commentary from former students about
their boarding-school experiences, countless
stories reveal physical and emotional abuse at
these institutions.</p>

<p>Why did tribal members seek relationships
with missionaries? Some recognized the spiritual
power of Christian emissaries. The Blackfoot,
for instance, described eminent Jesuit
missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet as "the man
who talks to the Great Spirit." Others saw missionaries
of different denominations as potential
allies, capable of supporting them against
unpopular federal agents and assimilation
programs. After their removal to Kansas in the
1820s, Ohio Shawnees sided with Baptist missionaries
while relatives from Missouri cultivated
the support of Methodists. On the Lakotas'
Pine Ridge Reservation in the 1880s,
American Horse's people generally turned to
Episcopalians while Red Cloud's folk allied
with Jesuit Catholics. In this way, missionary
support reinforced preexistent tribal divisions.</p>

<p>Religious leaders often promoted tribal traditions
at the expense of the federal assimilation
agenda in order to gain converts. Some
missions promoted "English only" rules for
students in boarding schools while perpetuating
adult use of tribal languages. Many missionaries
learned tribal languages to cultivate
support for their Christian message. <hi rend="smallcaps">ABCFM</hi>
missionary Stephen Riggs, impatient for the
Santee Sioux to understand English, learned
the Dakota language to preach Christianity.
He also published a Dakota grammar and dictionary
in 1851 and <title level="m">Dakota Odowan</title>, a hymnbook
in 1853. By the end of his life in 1883, he
had published a translation of the Bible in
Dakota. Presbyterian missionaries Samuel Irvin
and William Hamilton unintentionally
supported Iowa and Sac traditions. Their recorded
observations of these tribal cultures
from 1837 to 1853 stand today as significant
ethnographic sources despite their obvious
ethnocentric biases. Methodist Rev. John Mc-Dougall
in southern Alberta went so far as to
argue against the Canadian policy of suppressing
the Sun Dance and Thirst Dance on the
grounds of religious liberty.</p>

<p>Tribal members also crossed cultural barriers.
Over time, many joined Christian denominations,
even serving within organizational
structures as true "Indian" missionaries.
Still, they retained their tribal identities. Kickapoo
leader Kennekuk cloaked himself in Methodist
garb while promoting a nativist agenda.
The Kickapoo prophet used his prominence to
delay for fourteen years his people's removal
from their Illinois homelands to Kansas. In
addition, he promoted religious traditions that
incorporated rituals and beliefs that drew his
people, as well as his Potawatomi converts, beyond
Methodist norms. Despite his persistent
Lakota identity, Black Elk served as a Catholic
catechist on the Pine Ridge Reservation.</p>

<p>Canadian religious leaders, perhaps even
more than their American counterparts, promoted
the cultivation of Native missionaries.
Dakota tribal members John Thunder and Peter
Hunter, of the Birdtail Creek Reserve in
southern Manitoba, gained employment from
the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian
Church. From 1887 to 1912 they served
as ministers to their Dakota people in the
Northern Great Plains. Both men used their
missionary offices to improve their people's
status within Canadian and American societies.
In these capacities, Thunder and Hunter
preached Christianity in the Dakota language
and promoted an agenda aimed at improved
conditions for Native peoples. Some Indian
missionaries crossed tribal lines to spread the
Christian message. Ojibwa-born Shahwanegezhick
of Ontario, who took the name Henry
Bird Steinhauer, introduced Methodist tradition
to the Crees of Alberta.</p>

<p>Over time, Native Americans across the
Great Plains incorporated Christian traditions
into their tribal identities. Missionaries erred,
however, in their estimation that they could
replace tribal traditions with Christianity. On
the Omaha Reservation in Nebraska, prominent
La Flesche family members claimed elements
of Presbyterian tradition that did not
clash with their tribal identities. Some contemporary
Native Americans choose to blend
tribal traditions with Christianity by praying
to Jesus in a sweat lodge and the Great Spirit
in churches. Other Native Americans see no
need for religious exclusivity. They distinctly
practice tribal, Christian, and Native American
Church traditions throughout their lives.
Many contemporary tribal members still essentially
ignore Christian traditions.</p>

<p>Missionary practices changed in tone during
the twentieth century. By the 1920s some
Christian denominations grew more tolerant
of certain tribal traditions. Following World
War II, urban ministries arose to work with
tribal members drawn to cities for economic
and educational opportunities. The later decades
of the century witnessed declining ministerial
staff and revived interest in Native
American communities, leading to increased
missionary alliances. Pine Ridge, South Dakota,
and Bismarck, North Dakota, now host
ecumenical ministries serving tribal members
from different denominational backgrounds.
Ironically, many contemporary clergy grow
increasingly involved in tribal rituals, to the
point of suggesting potential Christian "conversion"
to Native American traditions.</p>
