<head type="main">METHODISM, UNITED STATES</head>

<p>Methodism emerged as a lay organization
within the Church of England in the mid–eighteenth
century and separated from that
parent body in 1784. By that time, Methodist
evangelists had been active in North America
for more than twenty years, spreading a religion
that emphasized the primacy of the Bible,
but also the importance of reason, experience,
and social action. The sermons of John Wesley,
the founder of Methodism, and the inspirational
hymns of his younger brother Charles
were, and are, the heart of the theology.</p>

<p>In the United States, Methodism quickly
became the most successful frontier religion,
spreading westward in step with the expansion
of the nation. (See the entry on Canadian
Wesleyan Methodism for the Canadian story.)
The emphasis on personal salvation, the galvanizing
effect of Charles's hymns, and especially
the groundswell of conversion through
circuit rider preaching and camp meetings accounted
for this rapid growth. By 1830 Methodism
dominated more American counties
than any other denomination. Also by 1830
Methodism had reached the Great Plains,
with the establishment of the Shawnee Mission
in what is now Kansas. Over the next
thirty years, Methodist missions were established
in Kansas and Indian Territory for the
Delawares (1832), Choctaws (1832), Kickapoos
(1833), Peorias (1833), Potawatomis (1837),
Senecas (1839), Quapaws (1843), and Sauk and
Fox (1860).</p>

<p>The Methodist Church established conferences&#8211;its
system of regional organization&#8211;in
Nebraska and Kansas soon after the Civil War
and continued its extraordinary rate of expansion
into the Great Plains. Only a series of
schisms, mainly over the issues of centralized
control and slavery, slowed the advance. By
1890 most counties in the eastern half of Kansas
and across the entire breadth of southern
Nebraska had more than eleven Methodist
churches; many had more than twenty.</p>

<p>Methodism continued to gain members in
the Great Plains and in the country as a whole
to about 1970, when national membership
reached about 11 million. Most of the branches
of the denomination were reunited in 1939 and
in 1968 as the United Methodist Church. By
1950, while the number of Methodist churches
per county in the core area of Kansas and Nebraska
had fallen, as other denominations became
established, most counties in the Great
Plains had at least three Methodist churches.
But thereafter, and in common with many
other mainline Protestant denominations,
church membership declined nationally and
regionally. In 1990 Methodists accounted for
17.8 percent of denominational membership
in Kansas (compared to 28.5 percent in 1890),
second only to Roman Catholics. In Texas,
Methodists ranked third behind Roman Catholics
and Baptists, with 9.3 percent of denominational
membership (compared to 32.3 percent
in 1890), and in Nebraska Methodists
accounted for 14.5 percent of denominational
membership (compared to 22.1 percent in
1890), behind Catholics and Lutherans. In
other Great Plains states in 1990, Methodism
ranked third in New Mexico in denominational
membership (6.2 percent), second in
Oklahoma (15.6 percent), fifth in Colorado
(7.2 percent), sixth in Wyoming (4.9 percent),
third in South Dakota (9.2 percent), third in
North Dakota (4.9 percent), and fifth in Montana
(5.7 percent).</p>

<p>Despite the recent decline, however, Methodism
continues to exert a major influence on
Great Plains land and life. Methodism has always
emphasized education, and fifteen theological
seminars, universities, and colleges in
the Great Plains are associated with the Methodist
Church. Among them are Iliff School of
Theology (Denver, Colorado), Dakota Wesleyan
University (Mitchell, South Dakota),
Rocky Mountain College (Billings, Montana),
Nebraska Wesleyan University (Lincoln, Nebraska),
Baker University (Baldwin City, Kansas),
Oklahoma City University (Oklahoma),
and Texas Wesleyan University (Fort Worth,
Texas). While many rural Methodist churches
are humble frame buildings, some church
structures are prominent landscape features.
Trinity Methodist, completed in Denver in
1887, has a 182-foot spire and once dominated
the city's skyline; and the Art Deco-style Boston
Avenue Methodist Church of Tulsa, Oklahoma,
designed in 1926 by Bruce Goff, has a
280-foot tower and an auditorium that can
hold 1,800 worshipers. In Kansas, Methodism
is the leading denomination in most counties,
and Methodism is still regarded as one of the
two foundations of Kansas culture, the other
being the Republican Party.</p>
