<head type="main">PRESBYTERIANISM</head>

<p>Presbyterians trace their theology to the Reformed
tradition of John Calvin and their
church structure to the Scottish reformer
John Knox. The title Presbyterian describes
the leadership in each church of "presbyters,"
otherwise known as elders or bishops. The
Presbyterian system of government involves a
series of three courts: the session, comprised
of the pastor and elders of a local congregation;
the presbytery or synod, comprised of
the pastors and elders from a region; and the
general assembly, a denominationwide meeting
held annually. The growth of Presbyterianism
in the Great Plains was driven by a missionary
zeal to win Christian converts among
Native peoples, a need to organize churches
for the spreading American and Canadian
populations, and a desire to promote a Protestant
Christian civility.</p>

<p>Even preceding the arrival of missionaries in
the Great Plains, Presbyterianism took root in
the Red River Settlement in 1812, with its predominantly
Scottish population. Missionary
activity began in earnest in the 1830s with
sponsorship from the Board of Foreign Missions.
Rev. John Dunbar and Samuel Allis were
sent to live in difficult and often dangerous
circumstances with the Pawnees from 1834 to
1845. The father and son team, Reverends T. S.
Williamson and John P. Williamson, ministered
to the Lakotas from 1835 to 1898. Both
Dunbar and the Williamsons learned the Native
languages and translated parts of the Bible
into them. Their program was to change the
entire cultures&#8211;religion, education, and ways
of life&#8211;in order to prepare the Native peoples
for responsible American citizenship. To this
end, John Williamson also established a school
and a Dakota-language newspaper, <title level="j">Word Carrier</title>,
in 1871. Presbyterian missionaries to the
Plains were also sponsored by the Board of
Home Missions after 1870.</p>

<p>Presbyterianism spread into the Plains in
the second half of the nineteenth century with
European American settlement. In the Canadian
Prairie Provinces, Presbyterians played
an important role in the Social Gospel movement,
which sought to apply the principles of
Christianity to social reform. In the United
States the establishment of numerous Presbyterian
churches was accomplished by Sheldon
Jackson, who was sent west by three presbyteries
in the synod of Iowa in 1869. In the first
year alone, he traveled 29,000 miles and organized
twenty-two churches. Still, despite the
western expansion, the core areas of Presbyterianism
in both Canada and the United States
remained in the East. Although there are now
more than 1,500 Presbyterian churches in the
U.S. Great Plains, Presbyterianism tends to
rank third or fourth in numbers among Protestant
denominations, behind Methodists (in
the Central Plains), Baptists (in the Southern
Plains), and Lutherans (in the Northern
Plains).</p>
