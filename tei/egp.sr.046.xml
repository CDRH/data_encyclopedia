<head type="main">RYUN, JIM (b. 1947)</head>

<p>James Ronald Ryun was the world's fastest
miler in the mid-1960s. Born on April 29,
1947, Ryun grew up in Wichita, Kansas, and
began running as a gangly freshman at East
High School. Ryun became the first high
school runner to break four minutes in the
mile, running 3:59.0 in 1964 as a seventeen-year-old.
Later that year, Ryun finished third
in the U.S. Olympic 1500-meter trials and
competed in the Tokyo Olympics, advancing
to the semifinals.</p>

<p>In 1965 Ryun ran 3:58.3 to win the Kansas
state meet, then lowered his high school record
to 3:56.8 when he finished second to New
Zealand's Olympic champion and world record
holder Peter Snell in Bakersfield, California.
Two weeks later, at the Amateur Athletic
Union (<hi rend="smallcaps">AAU</hi>) championship in San Diego,
Ryun unleashed a powerful sprint during the
last lap that carried him past Snell to finish in
3:55.3 and win his first of three straight national
titles. Not only did the eighteen-yearold
Ryun improve on his high school record,
but he also shaved a tenth of a second off Jim
Greelle's American record.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps of world-class
milers Glenn Cunningham and Wes Santee,
Ryun matriculated to the University of Kansas
for his collegiate career. His high school coach,
Bob Timmons, joined Ryun in Lawrence and
directed a challenging interval-training program
based on running numerous repeat
quarter miles. This intense training produced
spectacular results: Ryun broke the world record
for the half mile on June 10, 1966, running
a time of 1:44.9 in Terre Haute, Indiana. Five
weeks later, on July 17, Ryun claimed the world
mile record in Berkeley, California, with a
stunning 3:51.3 that trimmed 2.3 seconds off
Michael Jazy's mark. <title level="m">Sports Illustrated</title> honored
Ryun as the sportsman of the year in 1966, and
he was also recognized by the Sullivan Award
as the top U.S. amateur athlete.</p>

<p>On June 23, 1967, Ryun lowered his mile
world record to 3:51.1 in Bakersfield, California,
with superb demonstration of his sit and
kick strategy, as he patiently ran in the pack
before sprinting his final quarter-mile lap in
52.5 seconds. Two weeks later, he broke the
world record for 1500 meters, clocking 3:33.1 in
Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Despite being the world's fastest middle-distance
runner, Ryun was bettered by the
masterful Kenyan Kip Keino in the 1968 Olympic
1500-meter race in Mexico City. An Olympic
silver medal was little consolation. After a
disappointing start to the 1969 season, the
twenty-two-year-old Ryun succumbed to the
stresses of adolescent stardom and intensive
training and racing and announced his retirement.
Three years later, Ryun came out of retirement
for another run at an Olympic gold
medal. He was quick to regain form, qualifying
for the U.S. 1500-meter team. Ryun's Olympic
misfortunes continued, however, when a midrace
collision sent him sprawling to the Munich
track in the semifinals. The ill-fated record
holder pounding the track in frustration
proved to be the final scene of his amateur
career.</p>

<p>A measure of Ryun's achievements can be
found in the longevity of some of his records.
His world record in the mile lasted almost
eight years, until Tanzanian Filbert Bayi ran
3:51.0 in 1975, shaving a mere tenth of a second
off Ryun's mark. At the end of the twentieth
century, Ryun still held all four middle-distance
American junior records for athletes
under twenty years of age, and his 3:55.8 high
school record was still three seconds faster
than any other American prep had run. It was
finally bettered in 2001.</p>

<p>Two decades later, Jim was back running,
this time for political office. Running as a conservative
Republican in Kansas's Second District,
Ryun was elected to Congress in 1996
and reelected in 1998 and 2000.</p>
