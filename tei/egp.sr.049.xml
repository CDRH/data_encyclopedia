<p>Perhaps the finest rough stock contestant ever
to compete in professional rodeo, Jim Shoulders
was born on May 13, 1928, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Familiar with ranch stock from childhood,
he entered his first rodeo competition
in 1943 at Oiltown, Oklahoma, winning the
evidently inspiring sum of $1,800.</p>

<p>Shoulders dominated rodeo throughout the
1950s, capturing an unequaled sixteen championship titles against other greats like Casey
Tibbs and Harry Tompkins. His strength,
coolness, and flamboyant spurring style won
him five all-around champion cowboy titles
(1949, 1956–59), an unprecedented seven bullriding
titles (1951, 1954–59), and four bareback
bronc–riding titles (1950, 1956–58). This cumulative
record has been challenged but never
duplicated.</p>

<p>A professional in business as well as sport,
Jim Shoulders has done much to promote the
future of rodeo. In addition to media promotion
as a member of the Miller Lite All-Stars,
he has worked in the rodeo production business
and maintained fine contract bucking
stock, including the famed "weather" bulls Cyclone,
Hurricane, Twister, and Tornado, who
was ridden only once in six seasons. Shoulders
also opened the first rough stock training
school (1961–89) for aspiring rodeo contestants
at his ranch in Henryetta, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Renowned in his chosen field, Jim Shoulders
was among the first to be inducted into
the National Cowboy and Western Heritage
Museum's Rodeo Hall of Fame in 1955. Other
honors include induction into the Pro Rodeo
Hall of Fame in 1979 and the Oklahoma
Sports Hall of Fame in 1989.</p>
