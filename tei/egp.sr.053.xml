<p>The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, popularly known
as Sturgis, is one of the largest motorcycle rallies
in the world. The event draws its name from the
town in southwestern South Dakota that hosts
the event each year. This Great Plains gathering
evokes memories of the fur trade rendezvous or
the end-of-the-summer country fair and carnival,
drawing people together for one more
celebration before the autumn.</p>

<p>The first full week of August turns the sleepy
ranching community of Sturgis into a motorcycle
Mecca. Enthusiasts come from all fifty
states and from around the world to attend the
rally. For one week Sturgis is transformed into
a large city in which all the inhabitants have
one thing in common: motorcycles. Most people
camp out in tents, and the traffic in Sturgis
resembles Park Avenue in Manhattan. The
motorcyclists come to Sturgis with their families
and friends for many reasons. They are
eager to find old friends, meet new ones, and
share stories of the past year. They also enjoy
examining each other's motorcycles. Motorcycling
organizations sponsor races and tours
through the nearby Black Hills, and motorcycle
manufacturers host trade shows that provide
a glimpse at the new model-year motorcycles
and accessories. Sturgis attracts people
from all walks of life to spend a week talking
about their motorcycles and their motorcycling
experiences and creates a strong sense
of camaraderie and an amiable atmosphere.</p>

<p>The rally has reached epic proportions;
during the fiftieth anniversary in 1990 an estimated
400,000 bikers attended. However, the
beginnings of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally are
much more humble. In 1938 J. C. "Pappy"
Hoel, a local motorcycle shop owner, encouraged
his friends to come to town for two days
of racing and fun. The first rally, sponsored by
the local motorcycle club, the Jackpine Gypsies,
attracted around eighty people to watch
nineteen racers on a quarter-mile dirt track at
the Sturgis Fairgrounds. The rally grew, based
on word of mouth, encouraging its founders
to extend the event and add additional attractions.
During the 1980s an increase in motorcycle
popularity produced a new generation of
enthusiasts eager to experience the Sturgis
Motorcycle Rally and races.</p>

<p>Motorcycle racing continues to be a focus at
the rally, but Main Street is now the center of
attention. The main thoroughfare through
town is blocked to automobile traffic, and
motorcycles are parked along each curb and
two deep along the center line. Guiding their
motorcycles through this narrow corridor,
riders blast their throttles, releasing a deafening,
ever-present thunder. While the street is
the domain of the motorcycle, the sidewalks
host thousands of vendors selling T-shirts and
clothing, patches and stickers, motorcycle accessories,
tattoos, food, beverages, and more.</p>
