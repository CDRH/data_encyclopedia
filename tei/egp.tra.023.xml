<p>On December 21, 1932, Carl C. Magee of Oklahoma
City filed for a patent on the first "coincontrolled
parking meter," an invention designed
to eliminate a major nuisance of the
automobile age, urban parking congestion.
Magee, as chair of the Oklahoma City Chamber
of Commerce's traffic committee, had
been asked to devise an effective method of
controlling Oklahoma City's growing parking
problem. The capital city was Oklahoma's
largest urban area. The city's thoroughfares
were used by 10 percent of the state's 550,000
registered automobiles, and all-day workers in
the downtown area preempted parking spaces
needed by customers of retail establishments.
Up to this time, Oklahoma City officials, like
those in other large cities, had attached fixed
time periods to downtown parking spaces,
with traffic officers enforcing the limits by
chalking the tires of parked cars and issuing
tickets to drivers who parked too long in the
same spot. This method proved to be only 5.
10 percent effective.</p>

<p>Magee, a New Mexico newspaper reporter
who had arrived in Oklahoma City in 1927 to
buy and edit a weekly paper, the <title level="j">Oklahoma
News</title>, quickly became involved in civic work
and volunteered to "solve" the city's problem.
He conceptualized a spring-operated timing
device, articulated precise specifications, and
in late 1932 filed for a patent. Then, in cooperation
with Dean Phillip S. Donnell, engineering
professor H. G. Thuesen, and other faculty
at the Oklahoma State University College of
Engineering, Magee sponsored a design competition.
Criteria for the device were simple:
it had to be small, attractive, windable, and
cheap to manufacture.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of the submissions
proved entirely usable, and in 1933 Thuesen, in
concert with Gerald A. Hale, his former student
and an osu engineering instructor, developed
the "Black Maria," a spring-wound
timing device that followed Magee's concept
and met his design criteria. Additional technical
work was accomplished by Adolph Schillinger,
a machinist from Sand Springs, Oklahoma,
and a working model of a manually
wound, coin-operated parking timer resulted.
In November 1933 Magee filed the patent for
this device as well, and in 1935 he incorporated
the Dual Parking Meter Company, with himself
as president. Refinements were added by
the chosen manufacturer, the MacNick Company
of Tulsa, makers of timing devices for
"shooting" oil wells with nitroglycerin. Magee's
third patent, filed on May 13, 1935, was
approved on May 24, 1938.</p>

<p>First trademarked as the "Dual" and later as
the "Park-O-Meter," Magee's brainchild was
adopted by the Oklahoma City council, and in
July 1935 175 units were installed in a fourteen-block
area of central downtown. Five cents
bought an hour's rent on a parking space, and a
twenty-dollar fine resulted if the car remained
after time expired. Many similar inventions
and "improved" models quickly came on the
market, creating a thriving industry in Oklahoma
and elsewhere. Although its legality was
challenged in court, the oft-maligned parking
meter was soon adopted by cities across the
United States for parking regulation and revenue
production.</p>
