<head type="main">WELLS, FARGO AND COMPANY</head>

<p>Wells, Fargo and Company, which developed
express, stagecoaching, overland freighting,
and banking divisions, was formed in New
York in 1852. Its principal founders, Henry
Wells and William G. Fargo, both experienced
expressmen, had earlier started the American
Express Company in association with John
Butterfield. Butterfieldâ€™s unwillingness to extend
expressing to California caused Wells and
Fargo with other associates to create a separate
company.</p>

<p>Based in San Francisco, Wells Fargo soon
became California's leading express and banking
firm. Aggressively branching out, in 1848
the firm acquired a financial interest in the
Butterfield Overland Mail. After purchasing
Ben Holladay's Overland Mail and Express
Company in 1866, Wells Fargo became dominant
in Great Plains and western stagecoaching.
Simultaneously, the company opened a freighting
division, which, among other things, transported
government and private freight by
wagon westward from the railhead of the advancing
Union Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p>The completion of the Union Pacific in 1869
caused Wells Fargo to deemphasize stagecoaching
and freighting in favor of its transcontinental
express service. Nonetheless, the
firm extended stagecoach and wagon express
into new frontiers such as the gold-producing
Black Hills. By the 1890s, when railroad networks
had finally replaced stagecoaching,
Wells Fargo was almost completely devoted to
railroad expressing and banking.</p>

<p>In the twentieth century, Wells Fargo's
banking interests expanded rapidly. First it became
one of the major financial institutions in
California and other western states, and then
in 1998 it merged with Norwest Corporation
of Minneapolis under the Wells Fargo name.
The merger made it the principal banking
firm on the Northern Great Plains.</p>
