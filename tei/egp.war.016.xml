<p>John Charles Fr&#233;mont explored large sections
of the Central Great Plains in the 1840s and
subsequently was military commander of
much of the region for the Union during the
Civil War. As the first presidential candidate of
the Republican Party, he also sought to prevent
slavery's spread to Kansas and Nebraska
territories in 1856.</p>

<p>Fr&#233;mont grew up in Charleston, South Carolina,
where he attended the College of Charleston.
He gained western experience by assisting
Joseph Nicollet in mapping the region between
the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers in the late
1830s. Appointment as a second lieutenant in
the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers
in 1838, and a famous elopement in 1841
with Jessie Benton, the daughter of Missouri's
powerful Sen. Thomas Hart Benton, set the
stage for Fr&#233;mont's emergence as a celebrated
western explorer.</p>

<p>In 1842 Fr&#233;mont inherited Nicollet's command
of an army expedition to report on the
emigrant trail to Oregon as far as Wyoming's
South Pass. Fr&#233;mont's expedition traveled
along the Kansas and Platte Rivers, then followed
the Sweetwater River to the famous pass
in the Rocky Mountains. On a second expedition
in 1843–44, Fr&#233;mont crossed the Kansas
plains to Colorado, then traced the Oregon
Trail to its conclusion at Fort Vancouver. Fr&#233;mont
then embarked on an exploration of the
Great Basin and a risky winter crossing of the
Sierra Nevada into Mexican California.</p>

<p>With the help of his wife, Jessie, Fr&#233;mont
prepared engaging official reports of his expeditions.
Along with Fr&#233;mont's maps of the
emigrant trail (completed with the assistance
of Charles Preuss), his popular reports provided
overland travelers practical information
as well as a new vision of the western Plains.
Unlike earlier dire images promoted by explorers
Zebulon Pike and Stephen Long, Fr&#233;mont
stressed the attractive features and potential of the Plains environment. His travels
along the region's rivers led him to remark on
the relatively well-timbered valleys; his wife's
romantic inclinations probably account for
the vivid descriptions of the oceans of green
grass speckled with beautiful prairie flowers.
Landmarks of the region, including Chimney
Rock and Courthouse Rock, entered the national
imagination through the Fr&#233;monts'
captivating account.</p>

<p>Fr&#233;mont's third expedition, in 1845–46,
culminated in his leadership of the Bear Flag
Revolt, which helped secure California from
Mexico. After a brief term as California's first
U.S. senator, two unsuccessful private expeditions
to map a central railroad route across the
Plains and Rockies, and a fortunate gold claim
in California, Fr&#233;mont accepted the Republican
Party's first nomination to the presidency
in 1856. His pledge to resist slavery's expansion
to the territories of Kansas and Nebraska
earned him majority support in the free states,
but he failed to overcome Democrat James
Buchanan. Nonetheless, Fr&#233;mont's impressive
showing guaranteed him a prominent appointment
in the pending national crisis.</p>

<p>In July 1861 Major General Fr&#233;mont assumed
command of the Union's newly created
Western Department, headquartered at St.
Louis and with responsibility over the vast expanse
from the Mississippi to the Rockies.
Complications in war-torn Missouri, as well
as crippling shortages of men, money, and
material, kept Fr&#233;mont from giving much attention
to the Plains. Political intrigues and
Fr&#233;mont's ill-timed effort to dismantle slavery
in Missouri precipitated his removal from
command in November 1861.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Fr&#233;mont retired to private (and
largely unsuccessful) business pursuits, although
he did serve as governor of Arizona
Territory from 1878 to 1883. Fr&#233;mont died in
New York in July 1890 from an attack of peritonitis.
His exploits were not forgotten, however.
Cities, counties, lakes, and streams from
Nebraska to California still bear his name.</p>
