<head type="main">STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND</head>

<p>The Strategic Air Command (<hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi>) was established
on March 21, 1946, to deter threats from
communist nations, prevent nuclear warfare,
and wage the cold war. <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> served to project a
global military presence as the bomber leg of
the United States nuclear triad that included
submarine-launched missiles and land-based
intercontinental ballistic missiles. Not solely
devoted to deploying nuclear weapons, <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi>
made significant contributions to conventional
warfare in Vietnam and Iraq during the
Gulf War.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> languished from inadequate funding
and unclear direction during its first years under
commander Gen. George C. Kenney. As a
result of the Berlin blockade and airlift of 1948,
however, the mission of <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> crystallized. The
Berlin crisis had exposed serious structural
and logistical problems that threatened the
ability of the United States to enforce its policy
of containment against the Soviet Union. In
response, Gen. Curtis E. LeMay assumed command
of <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> and set about building a credible
airborne fighting force. After moving its headquarters
from Andrews Field, Maryland, to
Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska,
LeMay instituted fundamental changes in
training, housing, food services, and recreation.
A pragmatic leader, LeMay prepared <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi>
for a war that could begin at any time and for
air combat and bombing missions that would
have to be deployed immediately. By 1949,
when the Soviets exploded their first atomic
bomb, <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> had mobilized its resources and
crew competence to levels sufficient to meet
this new challenge.</p>

<p>In the wake of the Soviet nuclear detonation,
the beginning of the Korean War, and
new initiatives detailed under <hi rend="smallcaps">NSC</hi>-68, the National
Security Council's blueprint for waging
the cold war, the role of <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> in the worldwide
defense of American interests grew. By 1950
<hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> had 225 atomic bomb-carrying aircraft
(including <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>-29s, <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>-50s, and thirty-four <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>-36s).
As cold war relations deteriorated and both the
United States and the Soviet Union developed
thermonuclear weapons, <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> expanded its role
in providing strategic defensive and offensive
capabilities. In June 1955 <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> accepted delivery
of the first <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>-52, the jet bomber that became its
trademark symbol. In January 1957 <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> headquarters
moved to a new control center. From
a two-tiered building, comprised of a threestory
aboveground administrative structure
and a three-story belowground war command
center, <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> coordinated its global presence,
controlling both bomber and missile systems.</p>

<p>In late 1957, under its new commander,
Gen. Thomas S. Powers, <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> assumed its wellknown
motto, "Peace Is Our Profession." Also
during 1957, with cold war tensions increasing,
the American military establishment put
its nuclear forces on alert status. This condition
continued until September 28, 1991, when
President George H. W. Bush issued a stand-down
order, ending a thirty-five-year period
when American nuclear weapons were on
launch-ready status and a certain percentage
of the American nuclear bomber force continuously
remained airborne. <hi rend="smallcaps">SAC</hi> ceased to exist
on June 1, 1992, when the U.S. Strategic Command
(<hi rend="smallcaps">USSTRATCOM</hi>), also headquartered at
Offutt Air Force Base, took over control of
the nation's strategic forces for the post-cold
war era.</p>
