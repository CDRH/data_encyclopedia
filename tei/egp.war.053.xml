<head type="main">WARTIME PRICES AND TRADE BOARD</head>

<p>The Canadian government formed the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board (<hi rend="smallcaps">WPTB</hi>) on September
3, 1939. The board was given a critical
and massive mandate: to control all supply,
manufacture, distribution, and pricing of
consumer goods and services. Donald Gordon,
appointed in 1941 as <hi rend="smallcaps">WPTB</hi> director, reported
directly to finance minister J. L. Ilsey,
who was a member of Prime Minister Mackenzie
King's cabinet. Gordon was responsible
for the work of five coordinations and fiftyseven
separate commodity administrations.
The scope of concerns that fell under the purview
of the operations of the <hi rend="smallcaps">WPTB</hi> were as
varied as sugar rationing, complaints of shortages
of baby diapers, price ceiling of consumer
goods, garment design restrictions, limitations
on distances traveled by commercial vehicles,
black market operations, distribution
of import quotas to manufacturers, and control
of the cost of living. To deal with these
issues, the <hi rend="smallcaps">WPTB</hi> had the power to promulgate
its own orders to ensure equitable and economically
sound distribution and sale of the
necessaries of life.</p>

<p>Eventually, the wpbt employed nearly
6,000 Canadians; many of the public service
administrators worked for the board for $1 per
year. Each province had a regional office and
several local offices in smaller centers. In the
Canadian Prairies, the capitals of Winnipeg,
Regina, and Edmonton were supported by a
total of twenty additional offices in such locations
as Flin Flon, Manitoba; Prince Albert,
Saskatchewan; and Medicine Hat, Alberta.</p>

<p>There was an additional volunteer corps of
more than 16,000 women across the nation.
They played a crucial role in the work of the
board's consumer branch under the direction
of fourteen Women's Regional Advisory Committees.
In the Winnipeg region alone, which
covered the area from the Saskatchewan border
through Manitoba to western Ontario,
more than 900 volunteers worked for thirtytwo
English- and French-speaking subcommittees
to monitor and collect information on
such activities as rationing, labeling, clothing
conservation, housing shortages, and price
checking. In their work we find the origins of
the Consumers Association of Canada.</p>
