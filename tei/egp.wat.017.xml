<head type="main">OAHE UNIT</head>

<p>Originally approved by Congress in 1944 as
part of the federal government's Pick-Sloan
Plan to harness the Missouri River, the Oahe
(pronounced a-WA-he) Unit was designed by
the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to divert water
from the Missouri River's Oahe Reservoir to
irrigate 750,000 acres of land in northeastern
South Dakota. The federal government offered
the irrigation project to South Dakota as
compensation for the loss of approximately
500,000 acres of land as the result of four federal
dams built on the South Dakota portion
of the Missouri River. Although the Oahe Unit
plan was eventually downsized to include only
190,000 acres of irrigation along the James
River, support in South Dakota for the project
was enthusiastic and widespread. For three
decades, every major politician and the most
influential businesses in South Dakota, particularly
the media, championed the project,
and it appeared that construction of the project
was inevitable.</p>

<p>But information in the Oahe Unit's environmental
impact statement, released in
1973, energized a small group of farmers and
landowners already concerned about the project.
Their grassroots group, United Family
Farmers, quickly grew into a large, sophisticated
organization aimed at stopping the project.
United Family Farmers members were
mostly farmers and ranchers whose lands
would have been severed by project canals and
ditches, drowned by regulatory reservoirs,
mitigated for wildlife purposes, or taxed to
build and maintain the project. They accused
the Bureau of Reclamation of bullying and
mistreating landowners and misleading the
public about the irrigation project. Oahe was
rare among federal reclamation projects because
many farmers scheduled to receive irrigation
water resisted the project. Their primary
concern was that their land could not
survive continual watering. Soil experts hired
by United Family Farmers verified that concern.
Environmentalists also opposed the
Oahe Unit because the project would have destroyed
wetlands, channelized the James River
and many small, prairie streams, and worsened
water pollution problems in the James
River.</p>

<p>By 1976, United Family Farmers boasted
nearly 2,000 members, and the organization
entered candidates for elections to the Oahe
Conservancy Sub-district's board of directors.
The conservancy sub-district had been
formed by the state of South Dakota in 1960 to
provide project supporters and the Bureau of
Reclamation with a government agency in the
Oahe Unit area that would promote and help
develop and maintain the irrigation project.
United Family Farmers candidates in the 1976
elections ran against board incumbents who
were supported by an organization called
Friends of Oahe. This group had been organized
by South Dakota's banking and construction
industries and Senator George Mc-Govern
to compete with United Family Farmers.
The rivalry between the two groups was
vicious.</p>

<p>Until United Family Farmers contested
conservancy sub-district elections, positions
on the sub-district's eleven-person board of
directors had been held only by individuals
who supported Oahe. Surprisingly, United
Family Farmers candidates soundly defeated
Friends of Oahe candidates in the November
1976 election, and the farm group assumed
control of the sub-district. That impressive accomplishment,
coupled with President Jimmy
Carter's plan to reform federal water project
planning and construction, encouraged Congress
to discontinue funding for the Oahe
Unit in 1977, which led to Oahe's demise.</p>

<p>United Family Farmers, now recognized as
one of the most innovative and successful
grassroots groups to oppose a Bureau of Reclamation
project, conceived and advocated a
congressional proposal that in 1982 traded discontinuation
of the Oahe Unit for authorization
of the <hi rend="smallcaps">WEB</hi> (Walworth-Edmunds-Brown)
water pipeline. <hi rend="smallcaps">WEB</hi> eventually became the
largest domestic water pipeline system in the
United States, delivering treated Oahe Reservoir
water to farms and communities in an
area the size of Connecticut in northeastern
South Dakota. <hi rend="smallcaps">WEB</hi> is headquartered in Aberdeen,
South Dakota.</p>
