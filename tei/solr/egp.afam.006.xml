ALL-BLACK TOWNS


Town council, Boley, Oklahoma, ca. 1907–10


African Americans left the South for the
"promised land" of the West in ever-increasing
numbers after the Civil War. Economic
hardship, racial violence, and intolerance
prompted this vast migration from states such
as Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Texas,
and Arkansas. With leadership from Pap Singleton
and Henry Adams, the "Exodusters"
settled mainly in Kansas in 1879–80, though
the movement had began a few years earlier
and lasted into the next decade. The opportunity
to own land attracted many of these
people to the Great Plains. Reports directed
back to the South claimed that landownership
was a simple and cheap prospect.

By 1881 African Americans emigrants had
established twelve agricultural colonies in
Kansas: Nicodemus, Hodgeman, Morton City,
Dunlap, Kansas City–area Colony, Parsons,
Wabaunsee, Summit Township, Topeka-area
Colony, Burlington, Little Coney, and the
Daniel Votaw Colony. Another settlement, the
Singleton Colony, seems to have never really
been a viable community. Many of the other
colonies lasted only a few years. The town of
Nicodemus, on the other hand, founded a few
years before the large exodus, prospered into
the twentieth century. African Americans also
established colonies in Nebraska, including
the town of Dewitty. They migrated to western
New Mexico, too, creating settlements
such as Blackdom and Dora. Oliver Toussaint
Jackson established the settlement of Dearfield,
Colorado, in 1910, one of the last African
American Plains agricultural communities.
Many African Americans dispersed elsewhere
throughout the Plains; most worked the land
like their white counterparts.

During a fifty-five-year period following
the end of the Civil War, African Americans
built more than fifty identifiable communities
in Oklahoma. Some sprouted and quickly
vanished; others still survive. Achieving freedom
after the Civil War, former slaves of
the Cherokees, Creeks, Seminoles, Chickasaws,
and Choctaws also formed towns in Indian
Territory. When the U.S. government allotted
land to individual Native Americans,
most Indian "freedman" chose land next to
other African Americans. Their farming communities
sheltered self-governed economic
and social institutions, including businesses,
schools, and churches. Enterprising businessmen
set up every imaginable kind of business,
including publishing concerns whose newspapers
advertised in the South for settlers.

More African Americans settled in Oklahoma
Territory with the land run of 1889,
which ordered "free land" to non-Indians. E. P.
McCabe, former state auditor of Kansas,
helped found the all-black town of Langston.
By means of the Langston City Herald, which
his traveling agents circulated around the
South, he and other leaders hoped to bring in
large numbers of African Americans whose
growing political power would secure their
prosperity and safety. McCabe never accomplished
his goal of creating an African American
state. Nevertheless, dozens of black communities
sprouted and flourished in the rich
topsoil of the new territory and, after 1907, the
new state.

In Oklahoma and Kansas, African Americans
lived relatively free from the prejudices
and brutality common in racially mixed communities
of the Midwest and the South. Cohesive
all-black settlements offered residents the
security of depending on neighbors for financial
assistance and the economic opportunity
provided by access to open markets for their
crops.

Marshalltown, North Fork Colored, Canadian
Town, and Arkansas Colored existed as
early as the 1860s in Indian Territory. Other
Indian Territory towns that no longer exist
include Sanders, Mabelle, Wiley, Homer, Huttonville,
Lee, and Rentie. Among the Oklahoma
Territory towns that no longer exist are
Lincoln, Cimarron City, Bailey, Zion, Emanuel,
Udora, and Douglas in old Oklahoma
Territory. Surviving towns include Boley,
Brooksville, Clearview, Grayson, Langston,
Lima, Redbird, Rentiesville, Summit, Taft,
Tatums, Tullahassee, and Vernon. Boley, the
largest and most renowned of these was twice
inspected by African American educator
Booker T. Washington, who lauded the town
in Outlook Magazine in 1908.

Immediately after statehood in 1907 the
Oklahoma legislature passed Jim Crow laws,
and many African Americans became disenchanted
with the new state. A large contingent
relocated to western Canada, forming colonies
such as Amber Valley, Alberta, and Maidstone,
Saskatchewan. Another exodus of African
Americans from the United States occurred
with the "Back to Africa" movements of the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
A large group of Oklahomans joined the illfated
Chief Sam expedition to Africa. Other
Plains African Americans migrated to colonies
in Mexico.

The collapse of the American farm economy
in the 1920s and the advent of the Great
Depression in 1929 spelled the end for most
all-black communities. The all-black towns
were, for the most part, small agricultural centers
that gave nearby African American farmers
a market for their cotton and other crops.
The Depression devastated these towns, and
residents moved west or migrated to metropolises
where jobs might be found. Black towns
dwindled to only a few residents.

As population dwindled, so too did the tax
base. In the 1930s many railroads failed, isolating
small towns from regional and national
markets. This spelled the end of many of the
black towns. During the Depression, whites
denied credit to African Americans, creating
an almost impossible situation for black
farmers and businessmen. Even Boley, one of
the most successful towns, declared bankruptcy
in 1939. Today, only a few all-black
towns survive, but their legacy of economic
and political freedom is well remembered.
