Born a slave to his mulatto mother, Miss Kill,
and plantation owner Sir Jennings Beckwith
on April 26, 1798, in Fredericksburg, Virginia,
James Pierson Beckwourth became a famous
African American mountain man. In 1810 the
Beckwiths moved to St. Louis, where Beckwourth
received his freedom. He joined Gen.
William H. Ashley's fur-trapping expedition
to the Rocky Mountains in 1824, working as a
horse buyer, blacksmith, and trapper. Beckwourth
fought against the Blackfeet in 1827–28, 
before being adopted into Crow chief Big
Bowl's band. He married several Crow women
while working as a trader for Kenneth McKenzie
and the American Fur Company in the
1830s.

Beckwourth served under the command of
Gen. Zachary Taylor in the Second Seminole
War in Florida in 1836–37, worked as a trader
for Andrew Sublette and Louis Vasquez along
the Santa Fe Trail at Bent's Fort and Taos,
and married a Spanish woman. In 1842 he
built a trading post on the Arkansas River and
founded the settlement of Pueblo, Colorado.
He raided horses from Mexican ranchos, participated
in the California insurrection in
1845–46, joined the gold rush in 1848, and
opened a trail, later known as Beckwourth
Pass, through the Sierras.

His 1854 account of his life earned him a
reputation as a liar because he exaggerated his
role in many events. He later supplied miners
in the Pikes Peak gold rush and guided the
army in the Sand Creek Massacre. After serving
as scout at Fort Laramie, Beckwourth returned
to live among the Crows, where he
died in 1866.
