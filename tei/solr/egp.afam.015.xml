COLEMAN, ORNETTE (b. 1930)

Avant-garde saxophonist-composer Ornette
Coleman, born in Fort Worth, Texas, on
March 19, 1930, came to the attention of the
jazz world in a 1959 groundbreaking engagement
at the Five Spot Club in New York City.
Although reflecting the southwest rhythm-and-
blues tradition of his native Texas, Coleman's
radical improvisational approach allowed
him to shift his music's flow and density
at will by dispensing with fixed harmonic patterns
and structural forms. This approach was
later formulated in his "harmolodic theory."
Coleman's tumultuous improvisations, despite
their irregular shapes and jagged lines,
often possessed a haunting lyrical beauty as
well as emotional directness.

The saxophonist's unorthodox approach,
emphasizing collective rather than solo improvisation,
divided the jazz world. Detractors,
including jazz giants Miles Davis and
Charles Mingus, described his music as cacophony
and called him a poseur. Boosters,
including Leonard Bernstein and Gunther
Schuller, hailed him as a genius. His influential
1959â€“60 group (with trumpeter Don
Cherry, bassist Charlie Haden, and drummer
Billy Higgins) was documented in two
landmark 1959 albums, The Shape of Jazz to
Come and Change of the Century. The aptly
titled Free Jazz (1960), a thirty-seven-minute
collective improvisation for double jazz
quartet, was equally influential. In addition
to alto saxophone, his primary instrument,
Coleman has performed on violin and trumpet.
Among his best-known compositions
are "Lonely Woman," "Ramblin," and "Blues
Connotation."

Although his influence has ebbed, especially
with the revival after 1980 of older jazz
styles, Coleman has successfully employed his
"harmolodic" approach in the electric-funk
group, Prime Time. Still, Coleman's reputation
rests on his status as a key innovator of
1960s' "free jazz" with its freewheeling ensemble
improvisations, open-ended plastic forms,
and "dissonant" tonal clashes. Among Coleman's
many honors is a MacArthur Foundation
Fellowship.
