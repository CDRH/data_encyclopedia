GREAT PLAINS BLACK MUSEUM

The Great Plains Black Museum, Omaha, Nebraska
 
    
The Great Plains Black Museum at 2213 Lake
Street in Omaha, Nebraska, has one of the
largest repositories of historical materials
and resources on the African American experience
in the United States. The museum
opened in the historic Webster Telephone Exchange
building in February 1976 with more
than 10,000 rare books, artifacts, magazines,
documents, letters, pictures, and other memorabilia
from Mrs. Bertha Calloway's private
collection. The museum was also supported by
a $101,000 grant from the board of the American
Bicentennial Administration. Other financial
support has come from private contributions,
voluntary donations, and state agency
grants.

From its inception, the central mission of
the museum has been the preservation and
enhancement of knowledge about the history
and culture of African Americans in the Great
Plains. Today, the museum has more than
100,000 items, displayed in several galleries,
depicting the diversity of the African American
experience in the region. The exhibits are
grouped into several divisions, each displayed
in a separate room. The military room, for
example, houses pictures, clothing, correspondence,
wills, medals, discharge papers,
and other documents. Other divisions are devoted
to African and African American arts
and artifacts, African American women of the
Great Plains, rare books, church and religion,
and music and entertainment. There are also
exhibits on African American homesteaders
and a section commemorating African American
political leaders in the region.
