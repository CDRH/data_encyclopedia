KING CURTIS (1934-1971)

Saxophonist King Curtis
    

Saxophonist King Curtis was born Curtis
Ousley in Fort Worth, Texas, on February 7,
1934. He spent his formative years surrounded
by Texas blues and swing, mainstream jazz,
and gospel music. After high school he followed
in the footsteps of Illinois Jacquet, the
Houston-born innovator of the saxophone
style known as "honking," to join vibraphonist
Lionel Hampton's jazz band in California.
He finally settled in New York in 1952.

In New York, King Curtis shaped his stylistic
influences into a fusion of jazz and the popular
"honking and shouting" of the rhythm-andblues
(R&amp;B) tenor saxophone. He recorded a
small number of mainstream jazz albums and
in 1958 led his own jazz group. In the 1960s
he was a prominent innovator of "soul jazz,"
which combined his early Texas influences of
gospel, blues, and jazz. His first major solo
success came with "Soul Twist," which reached
the top of the R&amp;B billboard charts in 1962; five
years later he had another hit with "Memphis
Soul Stew." Unlike his R&amp;B contemporaries,
he developed a sound on the saxophone that
could be as subtle as it was raucous.

King Curtis also garnered recognition as an
R&amp;B and soul studio-musician, becoming Atlantic
Records' house tenor-saxophonist and
bandleader for Aretha Franklin. His career
came to an abrupt end in 1971 when he was
murdered in front of his Manhattan home.
