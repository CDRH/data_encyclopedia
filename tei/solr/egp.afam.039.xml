SINGLETON, PAP (1809-1892)

Benjamin "Pap" Singleton planted black separatist
colonies in Kansas and distinguished
himself as a spokesperson for the "Exodusters."
Born into slavery in Davidson County
near Nashville, Tennessee, Singleton escaped
in 1846 to Detroit, Michigan, where he helped
fugitives find refuge in Canada. After the Civil
War he returned to Nashville, but the growing
pervasiveness of segregation, black codes, and
lynching violence soon convinced him that
African Americans could not trust elected officials
to safeguard citizenship rights in the
South. In 1874 he banded with eight associates
and organized the Edgefield Real Estate and
Homestead Association to encourage a cooperative
migration to the Kansas plains.

The group held an emigration convention
in 1875, but poverty and conflicting reports
about the suitability of the Great Plains for
settlement prevented them from making an
immediate move. In late 1876, however, Singleton
agreed to bring settlers to railroad
land in Cherokee County in southeastern
Kansas, and in early 1877 African American
colonists began arriving to build the Singleton
Colony north of Baxter Springs. High land
prices ensured the colony's rapid demise, so in
1878 Singleton redirected his attention toward
the unsold Kansas Reservation trust lands in
Morris and Lyon Counties and planted a second
Singleton Colony around the village of
Dunlap. While the second colony survived and
became home to the Presbyterian Church's
Freedmen's Academy of Dunlap, Kansas, the
1879 arrival of the Exodusters diverted Singleton
away from western colonization and
pushed him toward the goal of national race
unity.

Singleton became a self-appointed spokesperson
for the Exodusters and in 1880 declared
during testimony before the U.S. Senate that
he was the father of the entire migration. In
1881 he capitalized on his newly won fame by
organizing the Colored United Links (CUL) in
Topeka, Kansas, which he hoped would grow
to unite African Americans across the United
States in the cooperative development of
black-owned industrial enterprises and educational
facilities. The CUL never expanded far
beyond its Plains headquarters and soon fell
into decline. Singleton devoted his remaining
years to organizing or speaking out on behalf
of separatist and colonization movements like
Kansas City's United Transatlantic Society. In
1889 Singleton raised his voice for the final
time when he advised African Americans to
migrate to the Southern Plains and help turn
part of the Oklahoma Territory into an all-black
state. He reportedly died in St. Louis
in 1892.
