WARE, JOHN (1845-1905)

John Ware and family (blackpast.org)
     

By 1885, only three years after migrating to
the foothills southwest of Calgary, Alberta,
former slave and experienced cowboy John
Ware had earned a reputation as the "best
rough-rider in the North-West." Despite being
nicknamed "Nigger John," contemporary accounts
suggest that over time the color of his
skin had less influence on how people perceived
him than did his renowned strength,
riding skills, and gentlemanly demeanor.

Born in South Carolina in 1845, John Ware
was freed from slavery at the end of the Civil
War. By the late 1870s he had gained valuable
experience in Texas as a cowhand and herdsman.
In 1882, at the end of a long and arduous
cattle drive from Montana to southwestern
Alberta, Ware decided to stay in the area when
he learned that employment opportunities
with the large cattle companies were plentiful
for experienced cowboys. By 1890 Ware was
able to purchase his own ranch in the foothills,
and in 1900 he moved with his wife and
children to his second and last ranch, situated
along the Red Deer River, east of Brooks, Alberta.
John Ware died as a result of a riding
accident on September 11, 1905.

John Ware's personality and reputation as
a successful horseman and rancher accorded
him much respect and admiration during his
twenty-three years in the region. After his
death a creek, a coulee, a mountain, and eventually
a folk song were given his name.
