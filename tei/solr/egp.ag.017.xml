CANOLA

Canola is the product of several species of the
Brassica genus (primarily B. campestris and B.
napus). The name is derived from CANadian
Oil Low Acid. First commercially cultivated in
Canada in the 1970s, canola is rapeseed which
has had erucic acid and glucosinolates removed
through breeding and selection. Production
in the Great Plains is concentrated in
the Prairie Provinces. In 1997 Saskatchewan
led in both acreage (5.6 million acres) and
production (2.7 million tons), closely followed
by Alberta (4 million acres and 2 million
tons), and more distantly by Manitoba
(2.3 million acres and 1.4 million tons). By
comparison, relatively small amounts of canola
are grown in adjacent areas of North Dakota
and Montana, but virtually none is
grown farther south in the Great Plains.

Canola plants can be either fall-sown or
spring-sown. When seeded in the fall, canola
grows until cold weather makes it go dormant.
It begins to grow again early in the spring.
Fall-sown canola is more productive if it can
survive the winter. Breeding work is being
done to increase winter survival. The plants
bloom in early May with small yellow flowers.
The small, dark, shiny seed is similar to the
mustard seed.

Canola is raised for the production of oil
and protein. The oil is marketed as a "heart
healthy" cooking oil because of its favorable
fatty acid profile. The meal that remains after
extracting the oil is high in protein and is used
as an animal feed supplement.
