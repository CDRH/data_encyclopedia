CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM

The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was
one provision of the 1985 Food Security Act
designed to protect erosion-prone cropland
in the United States. The program includes
highly erodible land or land with excessive
erosion. The Great Plains, which contains
more than 23 million acres of erosion-prone
land and is sometimes called the "CRP Belt,"
played a major role in this program.

The crp provided farmers the opportunity
to receive land rental payments for developing
a ten-year contract with the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) to take highly erodible
land out of production by planting a permanent
cover of grass, legumes, or trees. The CRP
program learned from some of the mistakes of
the Soil Bank program of the late 1950s and
early 1960s. For example, only 25 percent of
land in any county could be placed in the program
in order to eliminate drastic repercussions
on the local agricultural industry.

More than 20 million acres in the Great
Plains were placed under protective crp cover
at some time during the 1990s. The average
rental rate was around $43 per acre. Texas,
North Dakota, Montana, Colorado, and Kansas
retired the most acres into crp. Although
modified, with increased emphasis on environmental
issues and water quality, CRP
continues to operate, with many contracts extending
beyond 2010. Critics have considered
crp to be an expensive program, with minor
effects on reducing production and stabilizing
farm income, but it has been very successful in
reducing soil erosion, improving wildlife habitat,
and increasing the quality of soil, water,
and air in the Great Plains.
