GARDINER, JIMMY (1883-1962)

James Garfield (Jimmy) Gardiner was born
on November 30, 1883, in Hibbert Township,
Ontario. On August 14, 1901, he moved west to
his uncle's home at Clearwater, Manitoba,
where he worked as a hired man and finished
high school. Three years later he moved west
again, to that part of the Northwest Territories
that would become Saskatchewan in 1905.

Following twelve years as representative and
minister in the Saskatchewan legislature, Gardiner
became premier in 1926. His first premiership,
lasting until 1929, occurred during a
period of prosperity in the wheat-based provincial
economy, while his second, from 1934–
35, featured a devastated Saskatchewan agricultural
economy. His move from provincial
to federal politics in 1935 launched a recordsetting
twenty-two-year career as Minister of
Agriculture. Gardiner first focused on creatively
using the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation
Act–with which his name became synonymous–
to provide financial, water resource,
and land-use planning assistance to Prairie
farmers. Later, he pushed the Agriculture
Ministry to the front of the national policy
process, developed close advisory relationships
with Canada's major farmers' organizations,
and became the leading voice for agriculture
in national politics.

Gardiner is also remembered for his use of
patronage in the Liberal Party machine provincially
and federally, his political abilities
within the federal cabinet, and his oratory in
parliament. As a cautious reformer within
Canada's dominant political party, he strenuously
opposed the social democratic Cooperative
Commonwealth Federation's attempts
to become the major voice of the
common people in rural Saskatchewan. Personal
ambition and a desire to win westerners
and "the people" back to the Liberal banner
following the ccf victory in Saskatchewan in
1944 led him to stand, unsuccessfully, for the
federal Liberal leadership in 1948. Following
electoral defeat in 1958, Jimmy Gardiner returned
to his Saskatchewan farm at Lemberg
until his death on January 2, 1962.
