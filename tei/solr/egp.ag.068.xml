SWAN, ALEXANDER (1831-1905)

Alexander Hamilton Swan was born in 1831 in
Greene County, Pennsylvania. He moved to
Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 1873 and soon after,
with other family members, established one
of the largest cattle companies in the West,
the Swan Brothers Cattle Company. Alexander,
who managed the business, started
with 3,000 head of cattle in 1873 on Chugwater
Creek in southeastern Wyoming, where he established
the Two Bar Ranch. By 1882 Swan's
herd numbered 33,000 head. The next year he
formed the Swan Land and Cattle Company
and sold the corporation to Scottish investors
for $2,550,825. As manager of the corporation,
Swan organized four other cattle companies,
including the Wyoming Hereford Ranch just
east of Cheyenne. Swan was the first rancher
to introduce purebred Herefords from England
to the United States. Under Swan's management,
the Swan Land and Cattle Company
holdings expanded to more than one million
acres and reportedly carried 110,000 head
of cattle. Swan's influence stretched east as
well where he was involved in the building
of the massive Union Stockyards in Omaha,
Nebraska.

Swan was also active in politics. As a Republican
he was elected in 1877 to the council
in the fifth Wyoming legislative assembly, but
he was defeated in 1880 when he ran as a delegate
to Congress. His ranching success came
to an abrupt end through a combination of
overstocking, overgrazing, and the disastrous
winter storms of 1886â€“87, which killed an estimated
300,000 to 400,000 head of cattle in
Wyoming. Swan filed for bankruptcy. His detractors
accused him of inflating the head
count of his herds and poor managerial practices.
Swan was sued by his own corporation
and replaced by John Clay, a harsh critic of
Swan and his business operations. Swan left
Cheyenne and died in obscurity in Ogden,
Utah, in 1905.
