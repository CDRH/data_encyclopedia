DAVIS AND WILSON

Architect Ellery Lothrop Davis (1887.1956)
executed a broad spectrum of projects, ranging
from residences to educational buildings
to military facilities, in Lincoln, throughout
Nebraska, and around the Plains region from
1909 until his death in 1956. Davis was born in
Florida, son of mathematics professor Ellery
Williams Davis. Professor Davis relocated to
Lincoln to join the University of Nebraska
staff in 1893 and was later dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences. Ellery graduated from
the University of Nebraska in 1906 and from
the School of Architecture at Columbia University
in 1909. He returned to Lincoln and
commenced his architectural career, working
briefly as a draftsman for George Berlinghof,
then joining him in partnership. The
German-born and -schooled Berlinghof had
settled in Nebraska in the early 1880s and enjoyed
considerable success throughout the region,
especially in public commissions such
as libraries and county courthouses, before
moving to Lincoln in 1905.

The seven-year partnership of the young
American and the middle-aged German was
highly productive, resulting in major, lasting
structures such as the University of Nebraska
College of Law, Lincoln High School, Miller
and Paine Department Store, and Security
Mutual Building (now called CenterStone), all
in Lincoln. Their public buildings continued
the skillful neoclassicism of Berlinghof's earlier
work, while their retail and office structures
reflected the tall commercial buildings
of Chicago.

Berlinghof and Davis ended their partnership
in 1917, and both men's practices apparently
were curtailed during World War I. In
1919 Davis hired navy veteran and University
of Nebraska graduate Walter F. Wilson (1893-
1970) as a draftsman. By 1921 Davis and Wilson's
collaboration had blossomed into a durable
partnership. From the beginning, public
schools were a mainstay of the Davis and
Wilson practice for communities throughout
Nebraska. In Lincoln the partnership built
numerous elementary and junior high schools
and the district's next three high schools in
1939, 1955, and 1966. Nebraska colleges and
universities also became major clients, led
by the University of Nebraska, where the
firm's many projects included Memorial Stadium,
Morrill Hall, the Coliseum, the Student
Union, and Love Memorial Library.
Their broad practice also produced excellent
churches, such as Lincoln's Gothic Revival
Westminster Presbyterian and Byzantine-flavored
Temple B'nai Jeshurun (both 1924);
handsome Period Revival houses in Lincoln
and elsewhere; and large and small commercial
buildings. The Stuart Building in downtown
Lincoln (1927-29) is a twelve-story,
mixed-use structure combining a large movie
theater, shops, and offices (now apartments),
crowned by a clubhouse, and featuring Lincoln's
only gargoyles.

Ellery L. Davis went into early retirement
for health reasons in 1931, five years before his
son Ellery Hall Davis entered the firm after
also graduating from Columbia. Wilson sustained
the firm through the Great Depression
but prepared to close in 1942 due to the wartime
cessation of private construction. However,
military projects supplanted private
commissions, and Ellery L. rejoined Wilson in
1942 to develop Buckley Army Air Field near
Denver. The enlarged firm also worked as engineers
or architects for several Nebraska military
installations.

After the war the firm's practice again
broadened to governmental, educational, hospital,
industrial, and commercial buildings
throughout Nebraska. A Colonial Revival
chapel for Hastings College in 1948 was a stylistic
exception, as the firm's work became predominantly
International Style. Ellery L. Davis
died in 1956, and Walter Wilson retired in 1965.
In 1968 the firm was renamed Davis/Fenton/
Stange/Darling to reflect ownership by Ellery
H. Davis, William M. Fenton, James H.
Stange, and Howard Darling. In 1994 the name
was simplified to Davis Design, which in 2003
remained the dean of Lincoln architectural
firms.
