KIMBALL, THOMAS ROGERS (1862-1934)

For more than a century the buildings of
Thomas Rogers Kimball have graced the landscape
of Nebraska and surrounding states. His
architecture has a refined character that reflects
his highly developed training. Kimball
was born in Linwood, Ohio, into an influential
railroad family in 1862. In his early teens the
family moved to Omaha, where he completed
his high school education. His formal education
in architecture began at the University of
Nebraska (1878–80). He continued his studies
at the Cowles School of Art in Boston (1883–
84), at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(1885–87), and finally with the artist Henri
Harpignies in Paris (1887). Through this training
Kimball learned to visualize structures in
three dimensions, and he was able to design in
many architectural styles.

Over the course of forty-four years Kimball's
buildings changed the skyline of Omaha.
Major structures include the Omaha Public
Library (1892), the Burlington Station (1896),
the Omaha Country Club (1900), St. Cecilia's
Cathedral (1905–59), Philomena's Church and
School (1908), the Fontenelle Hotel (1913), and
the Omaha World-Herald Building (1915).
Outside of Omaha, Kimball designed many
important government and commercial structures,
including the Lincoln, Nebraska, Telephone
Building (1894), the Dome Lake Club,
Sheridan, Wyoming (1895), the Hall County
Courthouse, Grand Island, Nebraska (1901),
the Battle Mount Sanitarium, Hot Springs,
South Dakota (1902), and the Second Church
of Christ Scientist, Minneapolis, Minnesota
(1928).

Kimball achieved a national prominence.
In 1896 he and his Boston partner, C. Howard
Walker, were selected as the architects in chief
of the 1898 Trans-Mississippi and International
Exposition held in Omaha. In 1901 he
was selected a fellow of the American Institute
of Architects, and in 1909 he was appointed by
President Theodore Roosevelt to the Commission
of Fine Arts. Walker and Kimball
were reunited in 1903 as members of the 1904
St. Louis Louisiana Purchase Exposition Architectural
Board, and they designed the Electricity
Building for the exposition. Kimball
served as president of the American Institute
of Architects from 1918 to 1920.

One of Kimball's major contributions to architecture
was made behind the scenes in 1919,
when he was asked to write the design program
for the Nebraska State Capitol Commission.
In this capacity he gave the architects full
freedom and flexibility, ultimately resulting
in Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue's magnificent
structure.
