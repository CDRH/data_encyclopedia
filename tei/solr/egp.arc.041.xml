ROADSIDE ARCHITECTURE


Waltz Service Station, Lincoln, Nebraska, February 1937


Roadside architecture refers to businesses
and building types that evolved in response to
the automobile. The most significant occurrence
of these buildings, therefore, has been
within highway corridors. The Great Plains
was crossed by numerous historic highways,
including overland trails and railroads. Automotive
highways represent twentieth-century
additions to these established routes; these in
turn were superseded by interstate highways
after 1950. Most of the historic highways were
east-west federal transcontinental routes such
as U.S. 20, U.S. 30, and U.S. 40. Early northsouth
transcontinental routes such as U.S.
75 and U.S. 81 are less well known. Other
early-twentieth-century automotive highways
such as the Yellowstone Trail and Route 66
were regional routes primarily associated with
tourist traffic.

Highways changed rapidly through time, as
did corresponding roadside architecture; early
routes and related businesses were often bypassed.
However, many types and periods of
roadside architecture existed simultaneously,
so buildings continued to evolve stylistically.
The necessity of providing basic services such
as repairs, gas, food, and lodging resulted in
the emergence of distinctive building types
as the automobile gained predominance after
about 1920. Other, more novel businesses with
specific architectural forms developed in response
to the automobile, including tourist or
roadside attractions, drive-in restaurants, and
drive-in movie theaters.

Roadside architecture–whether gas station,
combination restaurant/gas station,
or motel–often adopted regional references
based on local vernacular traditions as interpreted
for commercial or corporate enterprises.
The automobile traveler crossing the
Great Plains, for example, could find a sod
house or covered wagon tourist stand or a tipi
village motel. Such businesses, however, designed
to attract passing traffic, were not constrained
by historic or geographic accuracy.
Many highways through the Great Plains also
featured Dutch windmill gas stations and
Spanish mission-style motel courts.

Throughout the largely rural expanse of the
Great Plains roadside accommodations were
initially limited. Early travelers relied on established
businesses for food and other supplies,
carried camping gear, or stayed at existing
hotels in cities and towns along the route.
But communities quickly responded to the increasing
numbers of automobile travelers and
provided free campgrounds in public parks or
designated areas. Campgrounds led to commercial
enterprises such as cabin camps that
provided auto-camping areas and included
simple frame one-room cabins. A store with
gas pumps and a separate shower/restroom
building were often part of the complex.

Cabin camps and available hotels developed
into a building type–the motel–that was specifically
designed to accommodate automobile
travelers. Although many motels featured individual
units, they were often arranged into
U- or L-shaped courts connected by enclosed
garage spaces. Later (although all forms existed
concurrently), the motel evolved into a
single-story connected building with an attached
or separate office constructed of a uniform
material such as brick. Integral garage
spaces were no longer part of the building;
instead, automobiles were parked outside individual
units. Freestanding neon signs adjacent
to the highway became typical features.
A more ephemeral feature of many
motels was landscaping, typically a centrally
located flower garden or decorative shrubs
and trees around individual units.

During the emergent years of the automobile,
gas stations and service stations evolved
from existing buildings. Livery stables, typically
simple frame commercial buildings,
added automotive services. Separate buildings
soon emerged. In the 1920s throughout the
Great Plains these structures were similar to
surrounding commercial buildings—frame,
brick, or concrete block—identified by advertising
signs or, more significantly, by one- or
two-bay service entrances on the main facade.
Early freestanding gas stations were usually
small buildings with canopies, gas pumps, and
a small interior office area. Service bays were
attached to the main building, generally one
square or rectangular bay distinguished by
garage doors. As gasoline companies took
over along major highways, building designs
and logos became standardized. Small picturesque
gas stations became outmoded and
were replaced by larger porcelain-enamel rectangular
or square buildings with office, food,
restrooms, and service bays contained within
one building.

Drive-in restaurants and drive-in movie
theaters developed exclusively in response to
the automobile. Although both of these forms
enjoyed a period of popularity in the Great
Plains as elsewhere, the novelty soon faded,
leaving many such businesses abandoned.
Drive-in restaurants were characterized by a
freestanding building that initially provided
curbside service. The novelty of these businesses
was in placing an order from and being
served in the car. The limitations imposed by
the Great Plains climate, however, resulted
in either an expansion of indoor seating or a
truncated commercial season. Similar to gas
stations, roadside restaurant design soon became
standardized.

Drive-in theaters originated in the 1930s
and reached their peak of popularity and expansion
during the 1950s. Because of the
amount of land they required, drive-ins were
located at the edges of towns, typically on major
highway commercial corridors. The enormous
screen faced inward to the parking
stalls, which fanned outward to the edges of
the complex. The inward-facing screen, often
oriented along the major thoroughfare, served
as a large sign advertising the theater name.
Others with the screen located inside the complex
utilized freestanding signs that were visible
to tra.c from either direction. Again, because
of the climatic rigors of the Great Plains,
drive-ins were seasonal businesses. Unlike
drive-in restaurants, the vast amount of land
required for drive-in theaters often resulted
in developmental pressure, particularly along
highway commercial strips. This pressure,
combined with the faddish nature of their existence,
often led to their complete obliteration
in less than a generation. By 2000 no
more than a handful remained open in the
Great Plains.

Examples of roadside architecture, from
early motels with connected garage stalls, to
small cottage-style gas stations, to abandoned
drive-in movie theaters, still stand on the
landscape of the Great Plains. An architectural
phenomenon intrinsically linked with the automobile
and associated highway systems,
roadside architecture has characteristically
changed rapidly, and it continues to evolve.
