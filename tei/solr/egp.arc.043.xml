SOD-WALL CONSTRUCTION

Probably no building technology is as synonymous
with the Great Plains as the sod wall.
This construction material was mined from
the surface strata of Plains soils, complete
with the roots and rhizomes of prairie grasses
and forbs. The structural strength of the material
was derived from the root mass, whose
interlocking structure composed significantly
more than half of the soil strata.

The area of shortgrass and mixed-grass
Great Plains prairies constitutes the principal
region of sod-wall construction. While a few
examples are known to have been built from
true prairie sods in eastern Nebraska, Iowa,
and southwestern Minnesota, these are generally
exceptional. (Whether this is for historical
or environmental reasons has not been determined.)
Some true prairie grasses such as big
bluestem (Andropogon gerardi) were popular
for sod-wall construction in mixed prairie
environments where these grasses extended
westward along valleys.

The diverse expanse of the Great Plains affords
many different habitats for grassland
vegetation. Grass communities preferred for
sod-wall construction were sod-forming varieties
rather than bunchgrasses. Any level or
nearly level site with a contiguous stand of a
dominant, sod-forming grass provided suitable
material, but preferred stands were often
found in moist valleys, lowlands, or larger
sinks known as buffalo wallows. Under locally
advantageous conditions, bunchgrasses such
as the adaptive little bluestem (Andropogon
scoparious) might even be present in a sodforming
habitat.

Buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides) was one
of the most important grasses of the High
Plains of Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado,
where it was often found in pure stands. Its
sod is extraordinarily dense, with a structure
of fine but very tough and wiry roots spreading
widely in all directions. Together with the
roots of adjacent plants, buffalo grass forms a
dense, multidirectional mat with considerable
tensile strength. This root system allowed
for the cutting of bricks of great dimensional
stability.

Little systematic investigation has been
made into the biological composition of sods
in actual walls. Existing data come from reminiscences.
While many of these suggest that
pure stands of certain grasses were used, most
of them likely describe the predominant grass
in a mixed community. In the Central Plains
grasses most commonly used included bluestems,
buffalo, prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata),
and wheat, Indian, and wire grasses.

The antecedents for sod construction on
the Plains are still shrouded in mystery. Several
studies have speculated on origins, but
none has been able to prove its theory. It is unlikely
that sod construction originated from
immigrant introduction or "pioneer ingenuity"
or that it was copied from the membranes
of Native American earth lodges. Early observations
of the material do not offer reliable
evidence or provide clues. Sod walls were
often referred to as "dobes" by early observers,
and after the proliferation of sod-wall construction,
many clay-walled buildings came to
be called "soddies."

The earliest reliable account of the use of
sods for building comes from Fort Kearny on
the Platte River in present-day central Nebraska.
There, in 1848 Lt. Daniel P. Woodbury
started his troops preparing adobe bricks but
later shifted their effort to the cutting of sods
in order to speed construction. The technology
appears to have diffused from there up
and down the Platte River valley and then
to near and distant places around the Great
Plains. The diffusion, however, was concentrated
in the Central Great Plains.

Reminiscences and photographs of sod
buildings appeared in the latter part of the
nineteenth century, and these, together with
numerous extant structures, allow description
of a technology that evolved into the twentieth
century. Early photographs of older structures
suggest that the sod was cut with spades, the
sod blocks approximating the size of adobe
bricks. Often these blocks depict very crude
construction. Eventually, blacksmiths and
others designed customized plows not to
break the sod but to carefully turn it in order
to later cut it into building blocks. These ultimately
led to the development of the "grasshopper"
plow, which produced large blocks of
uniform cut that greatly enhanced the quality
of construction. By the 1880s this plow appears
to have completely supplanted all older cutting
technologies. The great diffusion of sod-wall
construction followed the development of this
specialized plow, which was manufactured in
and distributed widely throughout the Central
Plains.

Sod was used to construct a wide variety of
house types as well as numerous other buildings,
although multiple-story buildings were
rare. Plowed bricks–"prairie marble"–were
laid in masonry fashion grass side down, the
first layer typically on undisturbed soil that
had been cleared and leveled. Walls were commonly
built two bricks wide with staggered
joints and bond courses. Each course was leveled
with soil. The use of lumber as a leveling
device near midwall became a prominent part
of the evolved technology. Roof structures, almost
exclusively hipped, used dimensional
lumber and wood shingles. Walls constructed
for permanent abodes were hard plastered inside
and sheathed with a variety of materials
outside to prevent erosion. Finished with
wood floors and plaster ceilings, interiors were
like any other American house of the period
except for their greater thermal comfort.

Americans unfamiliar with earthen construction
initially experienced great difficulty
building good-quality structures. Considerable
experimentation was required to perfect
the technique, which often seems to have been
accomplished by specialized local builders. In
other cases, individuals built two or more
structures before achieving a size and quality
that allowed occupation of the same building
for more than a few years.

Like other American uses of native materials,
sod was considered a temporary and undesirable
method of construction. Most soddies
were occupied for only a short period
before they were replaced with industrial
light-frame constructions. Some others, however,
were occupied for decades by owners
who overcame the stigma of living in "dirt"
houses and who valued the thermal and economic
advantages of the sod house. The
evolved technology was thoroughly American
and became, though fleetingly, a significant
regional vernacular.
