SWEDISH ARCHITECTURE

Swedish immigrants moved particularly to the
Northern Great Plains, especially North and
South Dakota, although a good number of
communities also took root in the Prairie
Provinces and the Central Plains states of
Kansas and Nebraska. For example, the Swedish
settlement of Lindsborg in central Kansas
formed in the late 1850s and the 1860s. Now
about two thirds of Lindsborg's more than
3,000 inhabitants claim Swedish ancestry. The
western reaches of the Plains and the states of
Texas and Oklahoma attracted relatively few
Swedes.

For Swedes, as for other settlers, a dugout
or sod house often served as their first dwelling.
Sod blocks, used like bricks, were a cheap
building material, and a house could be constructed
by the settler within a week. In time,
the dugout or sod house might be replaced by
a log cabin and relegated to shelter for animals.
Whether sod house or log cabin, the
Swedish single-room cottage was the model,
with one big room (stuga) serving as an allpurpose
room, with a corner fireplace, small
entrance hall, and perhaps a small storage
room behind.

Replacing the sod house or log building
with a frame house was an important step in
the development of the pioneer homestead.
Numerous architectural plan books published
in the latter part of the 1800s presented a "picturesque"
American architecture with elements
of Swiss and English rural building
techniques as well as the Gothic style. The next
step toward the industrialized building process
was prefabricated houses, available from mailorder
companies in the early 1900s. The standard
patterns for frame buildings and houses
built of bricks and stones resulted in a definitive
break with the old building traditions.

Churches built by early Swedish immigrants
generally were copies of the vernacular
church styles of the homeland. One of the
most outstanding examples is the Bethany
Lutheran Church in Lindsborg. It bears a
strong resemblance to the cathedral of Karlstad
in Värmland, Sweden, where the majority
of the people in Lindsborg have their ancestry.
The church was built in 1874 of brown sandstone,
but in 1904 it was plastered with stucco
and painted white. Also in Lindsborg the
McPherson County Old Mill Museum includes
the Swedish Pavilion. Designed by the
Swedish architect Ferdinand Boberg (1860–
1946) and built in Sweden, the pavilion is a
reproduction of a Swedish manor house. The
building contains a large main room and two
wings. It was shipped in pieces to the 1904
Louisiana Purchase Exhibition in St. Louis.
Later, it was moved to Lindsborg in sections
and rebuilt at Bethany College, where it was
used as an infirmary and for classrooms. In
1969 the Swedish Pavilion was moved to its
present location and renovated. The pavilion
represents a Swedish building tradition that
is rare among Plains pioneer buildings and
serves to remind Swedish Americans of the
traditions of their home country.
