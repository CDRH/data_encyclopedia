BODMER, KARL (1809-1893)

Karl Bodmer, painter of perhaps the finest of
all Plains Indian portraits, was born on February
11, 1809, in Zurich, Switzerland, where
he received artistic training from his uncle,
landscape painter and engraver Johann Jakob
Meyer.

In 1832 naturalist and explorer Prince Maximilian
of Wied-Neuwied contracted Bodmer's
services for an expedition to North America.
Their journey lasted from July 1832 to July
1834, but the most important phase began in
April 1833, when they set out on a voyage up
the Missouri River by steamship and, later,
keelboat. During stops at trading posts and
encampments, Bodmer composed watercolor
portraits of Omaha, Dakota, Assiniboine, Atsina,
Mandan, Hidatsa, and Blackfeet chiefs
and warriors but occasionally women and
children as well. He also painted village
scenes, ceremonies, and a wide variety of
landscapes. In August 1833 Maximilian and
Bodmer reached Fort McKenzie, near presentday
Great Falls, Montana, but, faced with
menacing warfare among the Blackfeet, they
turned back a month later. Spending the harsh
winter of 1833–34 in Fort Clark near presentday
Bismarck, North Dakota, the two central
Europeans established a warm rapport with
the Mandans and Hidatsas. Artistically and
scientifically, their stay at Fort Clark was
the most fruitful part of their journey. The
masterful–and ethnographically accurate–
watercolor, Interior of a Mandan Earth Lodge,
for example, was sketched over a period of
several months during their time at Fort
Clark.

After their return to Europe, Bodmer worked
for a decade preparing a deluxe edition of
Prince Maximilian's Travels in the Interior of North America, first published in German in
1839 but promptly translated into French and
English and illustrated with eighty-one handcolored
aquatints based on Bodmer's watercolors.
Maximilian's narrative has long been
one of the most important sources for western
history and ethnography, while Bodmer's
aquatints provided some of the most striking
and well-known images of Plains Indians. The
work, however, sold poorly, and Bodmer later
rued his involvement as an irretrievable loss
for his career.

In the 1850s Bodmer settled outside Paris,
a.liating himself with the Barbizon school of
landscape painters. Over the next decades he
achieved a creditable reputation as a painter of
forest scenes, and his engravings regularly appeared
in French illustrated magazines. Now
and then Bodmer may have nostalgically recalled
his American adventures, but for him
the United States was only an episode in a
career focused on wholly different interests.
Bodmer spent his last years in dire poverty,
estranged from his family, and he died in relative
obscurity in Paris on October 30, 1893.

After Maximilian's death, the prince's diaries
and notebooks and Bodmer's nearly 400
original watercolors and sketches vanished
into the Wied family archives and were only
rediscovered after World War II. In 1962 the
Northern Natural Gas Company of Omaha,
Nebraska, purchased this collection, which its
successor, the Enron Corporation, donated to
the Joslyn Art Museum in 1986, where it had
been on permanent loan.

Karl Bodmer was a consummate landscape
artist who captured often-haunting images of
Missouri River scenery and the vast prairies.
However, it is the Indian portraits for which
he is most remembered. Despite his lack of
previous training in portraiture, Bodmer captured
the physiognomies, ornamentation, and
attire of Native Americans with exceptional
detail and accuracy, and in his works his subjects
display the vitality one associates with
the finest portraiture. Less well known than
his flamboyant contemporary, George Catlin,
Bodmer nevertheless was a far superior artist.
