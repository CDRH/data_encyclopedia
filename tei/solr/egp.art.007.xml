BUGBEE, H. D. (1900-1963)

At the suggestion of his cousin, cattleman T. S.
Bugbee, Harold Dow Bugbee came to Clarendon
in the Texas Panhandle from Lexington,
Massachusetts (where he was born on August
15, 1900), with his parents in 1914. He studied
at Texas A&amp;M College in 1917 and the Cumming
School of Art in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1920.
Each fall, until the late 1930s, Bugbee traveled
to Taos to paint with his fellow artists "Buck"
Dunton, Frank Hoffman, Leon Gaspard, and
Ralph Meyers, often packing into the mountains
to paint with either Meyers or Dunton.
Advised by Panhandle-Plains cattlemen Frank
Collinson and Charles Goodnight and inspired
by the example of his idol, Charles M.
Russell, Bugbee portrayed historic and then-contemporary
Southern Plains life, including
cowboys, Native Americans, and flora and
fauna of the region.

By the mid-1920s galleries in Denver, Chicago,
Kansas City, and New York handled
Bugbee's work. In 1933, with the Great Depression
and decreasing picture sales, Bugbee
turned to magazine illustration, a practice
he maintained for some eighteen years. He
did pen-and-ink illustrations for Ranch Romances,
Western Stories, Country Gentleman,
and Field and Stream, among others. Additionally,
Bugbee also illustrated a number of
significant books on western history, including
J. Evetts Haley's Charles Goodnight: Cowman and Plainsman (1936), Willie N. Lewis's
Between Sun and Sod (1938), and S. Omar Barker's
Songs of the Saddlemen (1954). He also
continued to make easel paintings.

Under Roosevelt's New Deal, Bugbee painted
the first of five murals for the Panhandle-
Plains Historical Museum's Pioneer Hall in
1934. He later painted additional murals for the
Amarillo Army Air Field and a set of murals on
Native American life for the Panhandle-Plains
Historical Museum. He exhibited at the Tri-
State Fair at Amarillo, the Fort Worth Frontier
Centennial Exposition in 1936, the Greater
Texas and Pan-American Exposition at Dallas
in 1937, and in the annual West Texas art exhibitions
in Fort Worth. He also had numerous
solo exhibitions in Texas and exhibited in
Taos. In 1951 Bugbee became the first curator of
art at Panhandle-Plains, a position he held until
his death at Clarendon on March 27, 1963.
More than 230 Bugbee works are part of the
museum's collection.
