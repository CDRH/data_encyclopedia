GILCREASE, THOMAS (1890-1962)

Thomas Gilcrease was known as a collector of
Americana at a time when few others were
interested in the art, documents, and artifacts
of the Western Hemisphere. Eventually, his
collection expanded to include nearly 10,000
works of art, a library of 100,000 items, and
more than 250,000 artifacts. In 1949 he opened
a public museum on his estate in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
to showcase his collection.

Gilcrease was born in Robilene, Louisiana,
on February 8, 1890. His early life in the Creek
Nation of Indian Territory was marked by little
formal education and much hard work.
While still in his teens, his life changed dramatically
when the allotted land he had received
as a result of his Creek tribal membership
became part of a major oil field in
Oklahoma. Gilcrease proved to be a skillful
businessman, expanding his original holdings
and founding the Gilcrease Oil Company in
1922. During the 1920s and 1930s extensive
travel in Europe and visits to European museums
inspired him to initiate his own collection.
Pride in his Native American heritage
and interest in the history of the American
West provided a focus for his collecting
activities.

By the late 1930s Gilcrease was spending
most of his time developing the collection. In
the early 1950s, faced with increasing debts relating
to acquisitions for his museum, Gilcrease
offered to sell the entire collection in
order to keep it intact. In 1954 Tulsans supported
a bond issue for the payment of Gilcrease's
debts and the acquisition of the collection.
Gilcrease allocated oil revenues to
the city of Tulsa until the income equaled the
amount of the bond, a goal that was achieved
in the early 1980s. Thomas Gilcrease died on
May 6, 1962, in Tulsa.
