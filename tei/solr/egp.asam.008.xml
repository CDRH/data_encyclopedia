DEADWOOD CHINATOWN

Joining another western gold rush, Chinese
began to arrive in the Black Hills, Dakota Territory,
from Montana, Colorado, and Wyoming
in the mid-1870s. Their population soon
increased to nearly 300. Most of them resided
in the Deadwood-Lead area. Although some
of the Chinese engaged in placer mining, an
overwhelming majority of these Asian immigrants
found their calling in service businesses.
Encountering relatively mild racial
prejudice, the Chinese immigrants were able
to open their businesses anywhere in the region.
Chinese-owned washhouses and restaurants
dotted the city of Deadwood.

Nevertheless, the voluntary congregation of
Chinese in residences resulted in a distinctive
ethnic quarter. Located along Main Street and
at the northern end of Deadwood, the socalled
Chinatown was actually a multiethnic
community that sheltered Chinese, African
Americans, and European Americans. Contemporary
Black Hills residents often called
that section "Badland" because it was where all
the "bad" groups stayed, such as prostitutes,
gamblers, outlaws, African Americans, and
Chinese. The legendary and notorious Calamity
Jane once lived in a shack in Chinatown.
Curious European Americans and Native
Americans occasionally visited the place
and patronized the Asian business establishments
seeking cultural exchange or vice. Since
Dakota Territory placed no restrictions on
foreign ownership of property, the Chinese
owned most of the houses and stores in Chinatown.
From the late 1870s to the 1910s, Deadwood
Chinatown functioned as the social and
cultural center for the Chinese immigrants in
the entire Black Hills region.

Over the years Deadwood's Chinatown, like
many other frontier communities, survived
flood, fire, and violence. By the 1910s most of
the Chinese had left the Black Hills due to the
decline of the mining industry and the local
economy. As a result of the dwindling population,
Deadwood's Chinatown gradually faded
away. Today, frontier Deadwood Chinatown
has become part of the local legend.
