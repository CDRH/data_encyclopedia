DENVER BUDDHIST TEMPLE

The Denver Buddhist Temple was established
by a branch of the Jodo Shinshu, one of Buddhism's
largest sects in Japan, founded by
Shinran Shonin in the thirteenth century.
Economic conditions in Japan in the nineteenth
century drove many Japanese immigrants
to North America seeking employment
in farming, mining, and railroad construction.
Records indicate the first Japanese settlers
in Colorado arrived before 1886; a Japanese
cultural society was founded in Denver
about 1904.

Shin Buddhism followed the settlers to Colorado,
and on March 13, 1916, Rev. Tessho
Ono, a graduate of Kyoto Imperial University,
inaugurated a church attended by 250
Japanese immigrants. The Denver Buddhist
Church served also as community center for
many lonely Japanese. Eventually, membership
spanned the region, including Colorado,
Nebraska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Montana,
and Texas. The early ministers of the Denver
Buddhist Church traveled widely, visiting parishioners,
comforting the sick, and performing
memorial services for the dead. From
the beginning, the church organized cultural
events that supported traditional values while
Japanese assimilated into American culture.
Youth groups such as the Young Buddhist Association
(eventually the YMBA and YWBA)
and Sunday schools sponsored oratorical contests,
ballroom dancing, beauty pageants, and
a night school. Eventually, a Sunday school
curriculum was supplied by the Buddhist
Churches of America, headquartered in California,
guiding immigrant parents in the religious
education of their children. By 1934,
under the leadership of Rev. Yoshitaka Tamai,
there were fourteen branch temples within a
600-mile radius of Denver, and 300 families
were listed as members.

World War II and its anti-Japanese sentiment
were difficult for the Colorado Japanese
community. Travel was restricted and finances
were threatened, but most avoided the internment
imposed on their West Coast compatriots.
In 1944 a church delegation sought
an additional English-speaking minister and
brought to Colorado Rev. Noboru Tsunoda, a
second-generation Japanese who had been interned
in a camp. After the war, as many as
20,000 Japanese moved into the state to work
on farms. Church membership soared. At the
same time, European Americans took an interest
in Buddhism and in Japanese culture,
and myriad groups from Christian churches,
civic organizations, and schools visited the
church, resulting in an increase in non-Japanese
membership.

Determined to realize its dream of building,
the community raised $150,000 to purchase
land in downtown Denver. In 1949 they dedicated
their new church and created a regional
organization called the Tri-State Buddhist
Church. Over the next fifteen years the Denver
church added offices, Sunday school rooms, a
residence for ministers, an auditorium, and a
high-rise apartment building, Tamai Towers,
for subsidized housing. Eventually, commercial
establishments rented space, creating Sakura
Square, a Japanese cultural presence in
downtown Denver.

In a pattern consistent with national Shin
Buddhist trends, membership in the Denver
church has declined since the 1950s. In
1977 the Denver Buddhist Church became the
Denver Buddhist Temple. In 2001 the Denver
temple had an official membership of 454
and had informal affiliated communities in
Wyoming, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas, and
Oklahoma; two Denver ministers serve nine
affiliated temples with a total of 214 members
and visit distant communities annually.
