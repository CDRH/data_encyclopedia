VIETNAMESE

Significant numbers of Vietnamese first appeared
in the American and Canadian Great
Plains following the fall of the U.S.-backed
Saigon government in 1975 and the resettlement
of the first wave of Southeast Asian refugees
in America. Many of these early refugees
were educated military officers or professionals
who had worked closely with Americans
in Vietnam. In Kansas, Catholic sponsors
helped the first newcomers obtain jobs and
eventually establish businesses, while Catholic
refugees provided clergy for the priesthood
and sent their children to Catholic schools.
Other denominations or interfaith councils
have also provided continuing help and support
to newcomers, as well as educating an
often-unfriendly public about the reasons for
refugee presence in Plains communities.

Government policy in both Canada and the
United States at first emphasized dispersal of
the refugees to encourage assimilation and
avoid overburdening individual communities.
The availability of sponsors and employment
determined locations for refugee resettlement.
After initial placement, however, many refugees
made their own decisions about where to
live and work, and most preferred to live in
such areas as eastern Canada and California,
which quickly developed sizable Vietnamese
communities. With the exception of Texas,
which has consistently hosted the secondlargest
Vietnamese population in the United
States since 1980, American Great Plains populations
of Vietnamese are generally low today
(less than 1 percent of state populations),
though they may be higher in some localities
and especially urban settings.

The situation is rather different in the Canadian
Prairie Provinces. According to the
1991 census, of the 94,255 Vietnamese living in
Canada, 20,210 lived in the Prairie Provinces,
and 15,135 in Alberta alone. Almost all live in
the larger urban centers and many operate
restaurants or other small businesses. One significant
difference between the American and
Canadian situations is that there was already a
core of approximately 1,500 young and welleducated
Vietnamese in Canada in 1975. They
had come as students to study at French Canadian
universities, and they early established a
strong cultural and religious presence. Subsequently,
the Vietnamese integrated relatively
easily into Canadian economic, social, and
cultural life.

Settling near relatives or friends was nearly
always a consideration for newcomers, as
were employment opportunities. Refugees to
the American Great Plains sought manufacturing
or other jobs in Kansas City, Wichita,
and Denver, while meatpacking plants in
smaller communities presented opportunities
for others. Limited in their work options by
the language barrier, as well as by problems of
transferring skills and verifying credentials,
refugees arriving during the 1970s and 1980s
struggled to support themselves. Meatpacking,
though unpleasant and dangerous, allowed
newcomers to accumulate the capital to
buy a house, start a business, or extend their
education and training; meatpackers deliberately
recruited refugees as a source of cheap,
docile labor. One of the earliest groups of Vietnamese
to arrive in Kansas was sponsored by a
meatpacking plant near Wichita. Others soon
followed, and the expansion of meatpacking in
southwest Kansas in the 1980s brought several
thousand Vietnamese to the small towns of
Liberal, Dodge City, and Garden City. In addition
to the smaller meatpacking towns, urban
areas throughout the Great Plains, such as Lincoln,
Nebraska, quickly developed Vietnamese
populations.

The first-wave pioneers who arrived in 1975
were followed in the 1980s by a prolonged and
socially diverse flow of Vietnamese and other
Southeast Asian refugees, the so-called boat
people who fled from communist Vietnam on
fishing boats and other barely seaworthy craft.
Vietnamese refugees included Catholics and
Buddhists, highly educated professionals, and
relatively less educated farmers and fisher folk
from rural areas. The refugees faced severe
challenges, ranging from near-universal feelings
of grief and survivor guilt due to their loss
of or separation from close family members to
the frustrations of making a living in an unfamiliar
and sometimes hostile environment.
In spite of these difficulties, most Vietnamese
have survived–and some have prospered–
due to extremely hard work and the mutual
support of family and friends.

By the end of the 1980s Vietnamese were
moving out of the meatpacking towns of
southwest Kansas to other states and locations:
some to California to rejoin relatives
and friends, others to Texas or Louisiana to
take up shrimping or seafood processing.
Some who left later returned, either to Wichita,
home to a large Vietnamese population, or
to one of the meatpacking towns to earn more
capital. Parents discouraged by their own attempts
to move beyond low-wage, entry-level
jobs saw the education of their children as a
primary goal.

At the beginning of the twentieth-first century
the flow of Vietnamese with the legal status
of refugee has almost ended, though for
many years former refugees, now citizens,
have been able to sponsor family members as
immigrants to both Canada and the United
States. Urban Vietnamese populations are
growing from both natural increase and immigration.
The most fortunate early arrivals
have established successful businesses, educated
children through college, and are in
some cases ready to retire. In Alberta, Vietnamese
are now represented in the provincial
legislature. A whole generation of Vietnamese
American children has grown up in the Great
Plains, as evidenced by the Vietnamese student
associations at most universities in this
region.
