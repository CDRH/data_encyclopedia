CATTLE TOWNS

Often referred to (less respectfully) as "cow
towns," cattle towns were small frontier settlements
whose entrepreneurial existence depended
heavily on the trade in free-range cattle.
A typical cattle town lay at the junction of
railroad and livestock trail. It provided facilities
for the reception of herds driven up from
the south, their sale, and their transportation
to urban meatpackers, to midwestern cattle
feeders, or to the ranchers of the Central and
Northern Plains. While their principal commodity
was cattle, horses destined for ranch
use provided an important secondary commerce.
Although Ogallala, Nebraska, was also
a noted cattle town, the most famous were
those of post–Civil War Kansas, each served
by a trail from Texas.

The first was Abilene, organized as a market
for Texas stock in 1867. It flourished until
farmers overran its outlying ranges, ending its
access to the trail. Ellsworth and Wichita then
assumed roles as major cattle towns. From
1872 through 1875 these two–urged on by
rival railroads–competed for the trade. Ultimately,
rural settlement closed them both.
Dodge City became a cattle town in 1876. A
severe drought, temporarily retarding the advance
of the agricultural frontier, extended its
life as a Texas cattle market until 1885. Caldwell
flourished from 1880 through 1885. Kansas
finally closed its borders to direct importation
of Texas cattle, ending the careers of both
Dodge and Caldwell.

Local politics at the cattle towns tended
to center on conflict between critics and defenders
of the cattle trade. Critics consisted
of two groups. Farmers feared trampled crops
and the fatal effects of "Texas fever" on domestic
livestock. Many townspeople opposed
the saloons, professional gambling, and prostitution
apparently required by cattlemen
and off-duty cowboys. Businessmen invariably
closed ranks against outlying farmers but
tended to factionalize on moral reform. Three
political positions emerged. Traditionalists
fond of a lingering frontier ambience resisted
all change. Moderate reformers, mainly leading
business and professional men, favored
ameliorative measures: multiple police officers
to enforce tough gun control laws, thus
ensuring that good order accompanied commercial
sin; monthly tax assessments on saloonkeepers,
gamblers, and prostitutes to help
finance close police supervision (police salaries
typically constituted a town's largest
budget item); and, as far as possible, the segregation
of brothels and dance houses from the
main business district. Finally, there were
the radical reformers, chiefly evangelicals who
grew increasingly active after Kansas adopted
liquor prohibition in 1880. With the saloons of
Dodge and Caldwell now egregiously illegal,
local opponents of all social immorality rallied
under the antiliquor banner. Although
women reportedly comprised the hard core of
antiliquor crusaders, a male element eventually
resorted to violence to achieve reform. In
1885 arsonists destroyed much of Dodge City's
business district in an apparent attempt to rid
it of saloons and brothels; simultaneously,
a group lynched a Caldwell bootlegger as a
warning to other violators of the liquor law.

But the legendary street homicide associated
with the cattle towns has been very much
overdrawn by novelists, screenwriters, and
journalists. Between 1870 and 1885, including
justifiable killings by the police, only forty-five
adults died violently at the five major Kansas
cattle towns, an average of 1.5 fatalities per
cowboy season. Recent efforts by scholars to
exaggerate this low body count through the
use of criminologists' "per 100,000 population"
ratio have proved statistically fallacious.
Nobody died in a Hollywood-style duel.
Fewer than a third of the victims returned fire;
a number were not even armed. Four deaths
were accidental shootings. Famous "bad men"
(the term "gunfighter" had not yet been innovated)
accounted for few deaths. John Wesley
Hardin killed a man snoring too loudly in an
adjoining hotel room; Wyatt Earp (or another
policemen) killed a carousing cowboy; Bat
Masterson dispatched the murderer of his
brother; Wild Bill Hickok killed two men,
one a security guard, by mistake. In large
part, the low cattle town body count resulted
from businessmen's fear of violence, which
not only could escalate into property damage
but could also deter the in-migration of substantial
citizens and capital investment. But
potential violence always presented something
of a quandary for cattle town elites. Business
leaders felt it necessary to suppress the disorder
to which drunken and high-spirited visitors
were prone but to do so without causing
Texas drovers to take their business elsewhere.
Only the end of cattle trading in each town
resolved this dilemma.
