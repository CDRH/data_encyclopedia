FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA


Aftermath of a fire in Fargo, North Dakota, June 7, 1893


Fargo, located in east-central North Dakota on
the banks of the Red River, is the largest city in
North Dakota, with a population of 90,599 in
2000, an increase of 22 percent over 1990. Adjacent
cities include Moorhead, Minnesota
(population 32,177), and West Fargo, North
Dakota (estimated population 14,940). The
population of the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan
statistical area (Cass County, North Dakota,
and Clay County, Minnesota) is 174,367.

Fargo sits on clay-loam soil from ancient
Lake Agassiz, which resulted from melting
glaciers 12,000 years ago. The soil's fertility and
depth drew settlers to the region's bonanza
farms of the late 1800s. Fargo served as a railroad
distribution point for new settlers and as
a grain-shipping terminal. The city, platted in
1871 and incorporated in 1874, was named after
William G. Fargo, a Northern Pacific Railroad
director and founder of the Wells-Fargo Express
Company. In 1885 Fargo had a population
of 7,394, and by 1920 it was the largest city
in North Dakota, with 21,961 people.

Fargo is the seat for Cass County and is host
for several state and federal government facilities
such as the new federal courthouse,
named after U.S. senator Quentin Burdick. It
is served by the Burlington Northern and
Santa Fe Railway, Amtrak, and the Hector International
Airport and is at the intersection
of Interstates 29 and 94. Fargo hosts 4,056
business establishments. The adjacent cities
of Moorhead, with 1,101 businesses, and West
Fargo, with 550 businesses, bring the area total
to 5,707 establishments. Although agriculture
is a dominant industry, other industries also
are vital to the area's economy. For example,
Fargo is a regional health-care center, with
three medical facilities: Dakota Heartland
Health System, MeritCare Medical Center,
and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
Other major employers include North Dakota
State University, Blue Cross Blue Shield of
North Dakota, American Crystal Sugar Company,
Great Plains Software, First Bank System,
and Case Corporation.

About 30 percent of the city's employment is
in the service industry, followed by wholesale
and retail trade with 29 percent (the West Acres
Shopping Mall is a regional draw). The remaining
employment is in government, manufacturing,
mining, construction, finance, insurance,
real estate, transportation, utilities, and
communications. Fargo and Moorhead together
have a labor force of 103,120 employees,
with 99,950 in nonagricultural employment.

The area is home to several colleges, universities,
and vocational schools. North Dakota
State University is the state's land-grant university,
with a student enrollment of over
9,600. Minnesota State University–Moorhead
has an enrollment of 6,700 students. Concordia
College, a Lutheran liberal arts college,
has nearly 3,000 students. Northwest Technical
College–Moorhead provides training for
1,400 students. The area's primary and secondary
public school system serves nearly
22,700 students. In addition, there are nine
private and parochial school facilities that
serve more than 2,000 students.

Churches and religious institutions play
an important role in the community. There
are about 125 congregations in the Fargo-
Moorhead area, with about 32 percent of the
members in Catholic churches, 49 percent in
Lutheran churches, and the remaining 19 percent
in churches of other denominations. Additionally,
there are two Jewish synagogues
and meeting places for those of other faith
traditions.

Fire destroyed almost the entire city on
June 7, 1893, and floods have plagued Fargo,
including one in 1897 and another in 1997.
These events resulted in rebuilding booms that
shaped the city's architecture. A tour of the
city's homes and buildings reveals Classical Revival
architecture from the postfire construction,
Richardsonian Romanesque in many of
the downtown buildings constructed after the
turn of the century, and Art Moderne in buildings
from the mid-1920s to 1940. Popular vernacular
styles and period revivals can be seen
throughout residential neighborhoods.

The FargoDome is the largest indoor multipurpose
facility in the Northern Plains and
hosts athletic events, concerts, trade shows,
and conventions. Bonanzaville, U.S.A., adjacent
to the Red River Valley Fairgrounds, is a
reconstructed pioneer town with turn-of-the-century
houses and stores. The Heritage-
Hjemkomst Interpretive Center in Moorhead,
with a replica Viking ship and Norwegian
stave church, highlights the area's Scandinavian
heritage. Other facilities include the
Plains Art Museum and Red River Zoo.

Fargo is home to the Fargo-Moorhead
Symphony, which presents symphonic and
chamber orchestral works, and the Fargo-
Moorhead Community Theatre, which offers
plays and theatrical training. Sports teams include
the Beez (minor-league basketball), the
Ice Sharks (hockey), the RedHawks (minor-league
baseball), and the Fargo Freeze (indoor
football). The community's artistic and
sports atmosphere has produced celebrities
like singer Bobby Vee and baseball player
Roger Maris.

Several magazines and organizations have
ranked Fargo-Moorhead in lists of the most
kid-friendly, best small place to live, safest,
best place to raise a family, best for working
mothers, and best place to start a career.
