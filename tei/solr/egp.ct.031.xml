LUBBOCK, TEXAS

Lubbock, Texas, a city of 193,000 inhabitants
in the heart of the Llano Estacado of West
Texas, traces its roots to a country store that
George Singer established in 1882 along the
upper Brazos River. The tiny store attracted
area cowboys and a few overland travelers but
little else.

Eight years later, however, and a few miles
away, two groups of promoters established
separate towns, Lubbock and Monterey. A
compromise was needed, for everyone understood
that both communities, fewer than
three miles apart but divided by a shallow canyon
of the Brazos, could not survive. In December
1890, having reached an accommodation,
the promoters, led by W. E. Rayner,
Frank Wheelock, and Rollie Burns, agreed to a
third site, and a new town, also called Lubbock,
appeared south of the canyon where
they thought a railroad might pass through
the area.

Frank Wheelock, and Rollie Burns, agreed to a
third site, and a new town, also called Lubbock,
appeared south of the canyon where
they thought a railroad might pass through
the area. new town attracted businessmen, farmers,
and ranchers. Early in 1891 more than 100 people
lived in the town, and in the spring it
won election as the political seat of Lubbock
County. Before winter Lubbock contained
several stores, churches, a newspaper, and a
school.

Drought and depression slowed Lubbock's
growth, however, and its population in 1900
was fewer than 300 inhabitants. The Santa Fe
Railroad arrived, finally, in 1909, and Lubbock
immediately entered a boom period. As crop
farming increased, farmer-settlers replaced
ranchers in the area, and additional railroads
reduced the city's isolation. In response, Lubbock's
population more than doubled between
1910 and 1920, and the city soon became
known as the "Hub City of the Plains."

In the 1920s Lubbock enjoyed a second
boom. Texas Technological College, which became
Texas Tech University in 1969, was the
major cause. Established in 1923, the college
grew remarkably in students, faculty, and facilities,
continuing its expansion through the
1930s and afterward. Owing in part to the university,
Lubbock today enjoys a large symphony
orchestra, two ballet companies, several
theater groups, and many libraries and
museums.

In 1940 the city's population reached 32,000,
including about 1,600 Latinos and 1,000 African
Americans. During World War II Lubbock
expanded again as the city became an important
military center. The region's mild weather
and sunny skies made it ideal for Reese Air
Force Base, an air training station. Before it
closed in 1997, the air base, with its personnel
and large civilian workforce, greatly enhanced
the city's economy and contributed to its cultural
and social evolution.

After World War II Lubbock developed into
a major agribusiness center. In the 1950s the
city produced pumps, tubular goods, sprinklers,
farm equipment, fertilizers, and pesticides.
With its large processing plants, it became
a national marketing center for cotton.
Continued population expansion in the 1960s
encouraged the founding of a second college,
Lubbock Christian University. In 1970 the
city's population stood at 150,000 people, with
more than 31,000 Latinos and nearly 11,000
African Americans.

A tornado in 1970 leveled a residential
area just north of downtown Lubbock, killing
twenty-six people and injuring many others.
The tornado destroyed 1,046 homes, damaged
8,000 others, and left 1,800 people homeless. It
also damaged some 600 businesses. Lubbock
citizens rebuilt the area with a large civiccenter
complex and memorial. The rebuilding
process plus the construction in the 1970s of
Texas Tech University's Health Sciences Center,
a large teaching hospital, and the expansion
of the city's other hospitals made the city
a major medical center. By the 1980s Lubbock
was home to 292 industrial concerns, and it
served a wholesale and retail area covering
much of West Texas and eastern New Mexico.
It became the world's leading center of cottonseed
production.

Lubbock's cultural roots reach back to
agrarian southern traditions. Its citizens are
conservative in politics and informal in dress
and lifestyle, but Lubbock's society is entirely
modern. Its largest minority groups, Latinos
and African Americans, influence the political
and cultural life of the city, and their social
and economic successes have helped to move
Lubbock into the modern era and into a dominant
position on the southern High Plains.
