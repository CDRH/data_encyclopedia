RESERVATION TOWNS

The U.S. federal government, railroads, traders,
tribal governments, individual Indian
proprietors, and missionaries all took part in
the planning of towns on Native American
reservations in the Great Plains. Prior to allotment,
reservation towns were often located on
rivers for trading purposes, near missions, or
near Bureau of Indian Affairs agencies. As
railroads extended through reservations and
lands were opened to non-Indians through
"surplus" lands acts, new towns were incorporated
along railroads and in central places on
reservations. Some reservation towns grew
haphazardly until incorporation, when gridiron
plans were superimposed on the landscape.
Others were planned prior to settlement,
again commonly laying streets in the
four cardinal directions. Regardless of their
planning, reservation towns serve as bases
for both Indian and non-Indian communities
throughout the Great Plains today.

The functions of reservation towns vary
from being the seat of tribal governments to
being central places for rural Indian and non-
Indian populations and bases for economic
development. Some towns are largely populated
by Indians and house the tribal governments
and Bureau of Indian Affairs agencies.
For example, Agency Village, Lake Traverse
Reservation, South Dakota, was the site of the
old Bureau of Indian Affairs agency. After a
surplus lands act opened the reservation in
1892, the Bureau of Indian Affairs moved the
agency to Sisseton, South Dakota, six miles
north of the old agency. Nonetheless, the tribe
continued to hold its annual wacipi at the old
agency site. In the 1960s the tribal government
moved its headquarters back to the old agency
and named the town Agency Village. This
move enabled the tribe to create its own place
on the reservation separate from the town
of Sisseton, which was populated largely by
non-Indians by the 1960s. Today, Agency Village
houses one of the tribe's gaming operations,
the tribal community college, the wacipi
arena, a tribal elementary and secondary
school, the offices of the tribal government,
and many low-income housing units.

Other reservation towns, especially on the
western Great Plains, are populated by both
Indians and non-Indians and provide goods
and services to vast rural areas. Eagle Butte,
South Dakota, houses the tribal government
and Bureau of Indian Affairs agency for the
Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. The town provides
goods and services to people within the
2.8 million-acre reservation. The landscape
of the town reflects the presence of the tribal
government, with building after building on
the main street displaying the seal of the tribal
government. The tribal government owns the
telephone authority, the cable company, a
hotel, a grocery store, and a small strip mall
that service both Indian and non-Indian populations
within the reservation.

Reservation towns that are close to major
Plains population centers are likely to house
casinos today. The economy of Flandreau,
South Dakota, a town of 2,400 residents,
mostly non-Indians, has become increasingly
tribally driven and dependent upon gaming.
At the southwestern corner of the town is the
Flandreau Santee Sioux's small reservation
and large casino. The Royal River Casino has
expanded in recent years and now employs
some 300 people. The proximity of Flandreau
to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has enabled
the casino to achieve some level of success.
Through this success, the tribe has funneled
money back into the Flandreau community,
thus changing this place through economic
development and grants.

Like most Plains small towns, those on reservations
have a Main Street, often perpendicular
to railroad tracks. The tribal government
and Bureau of Indian Affairs offices are
located on or near the main street, as are other
major tribal services. Low-income housing
provided by the tribal housing authority,
Housing and Urban Development, or Habitat
for Humanity is located in developments on
the outskirts of the typical reservation town.
