HUNGARIANS

Hungarians, people from east-central Europe
who speak a Finno-Ugric language unrelated
to any of the Germanic, Slavic, and Romance
languages, immigrated to North America
in several waves after the mid-nineteenth
century.

First came the "Forty-eighters" following
the failure of the Hungarian Revolution of
1848–49. They were about 4,000 strong and
mostly represented Hungary's gentry class. Although
enthusiastically received, by virtue of
their social background most of them were
unable to fit into America's rugged society
of self-made men. Consequently, following
the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867,
which made them partners in the Austro-
Hungarian Empire, many repatriated to Hungary.
While in the United States, they generally
stayed on the East Coast. The only
exceptions were those few who settled in Chicago,
St. Louis, Davenport (Iowa), and on an
ephemeral farm community in southeastern
Iowa called New Buda.

The Forty-eighters were followed by the
650,000 to 700,000 immigrants who arrived
between 1880 and 1914 for economic reasons.
Although they came as temporary guest workers,
three-fourths of them stayed. Barely literate
peasants, they went to work in the coal
mines, steel mills, and industrial plants of
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Illinois, and Indiana. Their intention was to
accumulate enough capital to repatriate and
to make themselves into prosperous farmers
or well-to-do artisans. For this reason few settled
in the country's agricultural regions, including
the Great Plains, where the accumulation
of capital was much more difficult.
The only exceptions were those peasants who
after 1885 migrated from the United States
to Canada and settled in the region between
Winnipeg and Calgary, where they tried to
establish themselves as prosperous tobacco
farmers. The earliest of these Hungarian settlements
in Manitoba (Hunsvalley) and Saskatchewan
(Esterházy, Kaposvár, Otthon,
Békevár) were established at the initiative of
Paul Oscar Esterházy (1831-1912).

The quota laws of 1921 and 1924 and the
Great Depression drastically lowered the number
of Hungarian immigrants to the United
States to a total of just under 40,000 during the
1920s and 1930s. At the same time, immigration
to Canada increased. Whereas before
World War I only 8,000 Hungarians had entered
Canada, during the interwar years their
numbers more than quadrupled to 33,000.
With the exception of a few hundred highly
skilled scientists and scholars who fled Hungary
in the late 1930s because of the spread of
Nazism, interwar Hungarian immigrants, although
more mixed socially, still came for economic
reasons.

Following World War II, two major waves of
political immigrants entered the United States
and Canada: the "displaced persons," or DPS,
between 1948 and 1953, and the "Fifty-sixers,"
or "Freedom Fighters," between 1956 and 1960.
These two immigrant waves brought about
65,000 émigrés to the United States and nearly
50,000 to Canada. The dps represented Hungary's
elites while the Fifty-sixers were mainly
technocrats who left in response to the defeat
of the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist uprising
that began on October 23, 1956.

According to the U.S. census of 1990 and
the Canadian census of 1991, the Hungarian
population of the ten states (Kansas, Nebraska,
South Dakota, North Dakota, Texas,
New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming,
Montana) and the three provinces
(Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta) in the
Great Plains was 138,710, but only two-fifths
of these were exclusively of Hungarian extraction.
About 76 percent of them lived in
two states (Texas and Colorado) and two
provinces (Alberta and Saskatchewan). The
remaining 24 percent resided in the remaining
eight states and one province, where the
Hungarian population ranged between 1,398
(South Dakota) and 8,070 (Manitoba).

By virtue of the fact that three-fourths of
these Hungarians live in two states and two
provinces that are only partly in the Great
Plains, the actual number of Hungarians living
in the region is probably considerably less
than 138,710. For this reason there is little organized
Hungarian activity in the Great Plains
except in the urban centers on the region's
peripherieséDenver and Dallas in the United
States and Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, and
Winnipeg in Canada. Of these centers of Hungarian
life, Calgary, home to about a dozen
Hungarian cultural associations, is probably
the most important.
