POLES

Poles first began to settle in the Great Plains
in the 1870s, and today their Polish American
children and grandchildren are found
throughout the region, both in identifiable
ethnic communities and as individuals. Although
the first permanent Polish community
in America was established at Panna Maria on
the Texas Gulf Coast in 1854, significant Polish
immigration to the United States did not begin
until the 1870s and continued until the
passage of laws in 1922 and 1924 reducing immigration
from eastern and southern Europe.
Polish immigration resumed after World War
II with the arrival of war refugees and veterans
of the Polish army. The liberalization of immigration
laws in 1965 restarted a small trickle of
immigration, which grew with political upheaval
in Poland in the 1980s and continued
with renewed economic immigration in the
1990s.

Prior to significant Polish settlement in the
Great Plains, the region was visited by only a
few Poles. One was Karol (Charles) Radziminski,
a political refugee from the failed 1830–31
November Uprising against Russian rule in
Poland, who joined the U.S. Army and served
along with several dozen fellow Polish refugees
in the Mexican War. After the war, Radziminnski helped explore and map parts of
Texas and Oklahoma and assisted in the demarcation
of the new U.S.-Mexican boundary.
Like many Europeans, Polish visitors
to America were strongly attracted to the
West. Among the most famous of these visitors
was the Nobel Prize–winning author
Henryk Sienkiewicz, who traveled parts of the
Great Plains in the mid-1870s and met with
Lakota Indians.

Major Polish settlements in the Great Plains
began in the 1870s in central Nebraska and
eastern North Dakota. The central Nebraska
colonies were formed in Howard, Greeley,
Valley, and Sherman Counties as a planned
colonization effort of the Polish Roman Catholic
Union of America, a Chicago-based fraternal
association, and the Burlington and
Missouri River Railroad Company. Beginning
in 1877 the colonies were advertised in the
Polish-language papers as similar to the blackearth
regions of Ukraine. Leaders of the organization
envisioned the Nebraska colonies as a
potential Polish oasis where immigrants could
be delivered from the perils of the industrial
cities. Lack of resources, and Polish immigrants'
preference for wage-labor jobs in the
factories and mines of the East and Midwest,
frustrated these plans, but the Nebraska colonies
nevertheless attracted significant settlement
in more than a dozen small Catholic
parishes.

Although sporadic colonization efforts
among Polish immigrants continued into the
1920s, other major settlements, such as the
communities in the Red River Valley of the
North, were formed by the more gradual process
of chain migration. Beginning first on the
North Dakota side and later on the Minnesota
side, Polish immigrants established about
ten parishes, the largest being St. Stanislaus
in Warsaw, North Dakota, founded in 1883.
Small Polish farming communities were also
founded in Kansas, Oklahoma, eastern Montana,
and South Dakota. On the Canadian Prairies,
Poles settled in Manitoba (where some
40,000 Polish Canadians were reported to reside
by the 1950s), Saskatchewan, and Alberta
and were often found among the more numerous
Ukrainian Canadians.

Although most Polish communities in the
Great Plains were agrarian, industrial communities
formed as well, especially around extractive
industries. Poles mined coal in Oklahoma,
Colorado, and Alberta and smelted
zinc in Oklahoma. In many cases, Polish miners
came from Pennsylvania. The largest urban
communities were created around meatpacking
industries, especially in Kansas City and
Omaha. By the 1930s the Polish community
near the Omaha stockyards was estimated at
about 10,000, grouped around three main Roman
Catholic parishes, and was the largest
Polish community in the Great Plains.

In the first and second generations of settlement,
these scattered Polish communities in
the United States were tied to the much larger
Polish centers of Chicago, Milwaukee, and
the Twin Cities through family bonds or via
Polish-language newspapers such as Wiarus
(The Faithful One), Rolnik (The Farmer),
Gazeta Polska Narodowa (Polish National Gazette),
Zgoda (Harmony), or Naród Polski (The Polish Nation). Omaha had the critical mass to
support its own newspaper, Gwiazda Zachodu
(The Western Star), which was published
weekly from 1904 to 1945. In Canada the
Gazeta Katolicka (Catholic Gazette) was published
in Winnipeg after 1908. Winnipeg's Polish
community, reinforced by World War II–
era refugees, is home to the newspaper Czas
(The Times).

After World War II, aside from a number of
refugee priests who came to serve in Great
Plains dioceses, there was little immigration
to these Polish communities, although some
postwar and Solidarity-era immigrants did
settle in Dallas, Denver, Omaha, Calgary, and
Winnipeg. The children and grandchildren of
the earlier immigrants learned English, but in
most of the small communities Polish continued
to be used in the home and in church at
least into the 1950s. The distinct Polish American
culture created by the immigrants remains
viable in some of the larger concentrations
of settlement, as attested to by active
Polish fraternal societies in North Dakota and
the opening of a Polish cultural center in Ashton,
Nebraska, in 2000.
