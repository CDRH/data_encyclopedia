UKRAINIANS

Ukrainians from the provinces of Galicia
and Bukovyna, two rural backwaters of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, settled large areas
of the Canadian Prairies and some small areas
of the Northern Great Plains. They were
pushed to migrate by poor economic conditions.
Most land in western Ukraine was
owned by the aristocracy; peasant farms were
mostly fragmented, small, and inefficient.
Even for those with land, the system of inheritance
promised to reduce the size of their off-
springs' holdings. For most peasants the economic
outlook was dismal.

In 1880s Germans from Galicia had emigrated
to Alberta. News of their progress
reached Ivan Pylypiv in Nebyliv, Kalush
County. Contemplating emigration, Pylypiv
and another Nebyliv peasant, Vasyl Elyniak,
traveled to Canada in 1891 to visit the Alberta
German colony at Josephburg. They returned
to bring out others to settle at Star, near
Josephburg, in 1892. By 1895 chain migration
had brought in some thirty-eight families, all
from Nebyliv and the neighboring district.

In 1895 Dr. Josef Oleskiv, a professor of agriculture
at Lviv who was concerned about the
growing emigration of Ukrainians to Brazil,
published a pamphlet, Pro vilni zemli (About
free lands), advising against emigration to Brazil
and suggesting Canada as an alternative.
After a visit to Canada he gave it his endorsement
in O emigratsii (On emigration), a pamphlet
widely circulated in western Ukraine.
Oleskiv hoped to secure exclusive rights to
manage Ukrainian emigration to Canada so as
to prevent the emigration of unprepared or
undesirable settlers. The Canadians balked at
this, but they nevertheless cooperated with
him. The emigrants he recruited were regarded
as the best-prepared and best-led
Ukrainian settlers to enter Canada.

Oleskiv's work triggered a surge of emigration
to Canada in the late 1890s, over which
he soon lost control. Lured by visions of free
land, and often with unrealistic expectations
of rapid economic progress, thousands of
Ukrainians from Galicia and Bukovyna emigrated
to Canada. Before 1905, families seeking
land predominated; thereafter, single men,
many of whom sought work in western mines
and cities before taking land, formed the majority.
A small proportion, a few hundred
at the most, were lured to North Dakota by
American agents in Winnipeg. By the time the
outbreak of war in Europe halted emigration
in 1914, some 170,000 Ukrainians had arrived
in Canada.

Ukrainians settled in a series of large blocks
that arced across the northern fringe of the
aspen-parkland belt from southeastern Manitoba
through Saskatchewan into central Alberta.
This distinctive pattern of settlement
resulted from the interplay of an array of
forces: the environmental preferences of the
immigrants; their economic circumstances
upon arrival; the immigrants' desire to settle
alongside their friends, relatives, and countrymen;
the presence of German-speaking settlers
from Ukraine (with whom they could
communicate); the availability of off-farm
work; and the concern of the Canadian government
to prevent the growth of massive
blocks of foreign settlers. Unchecked chain
migration worried Canadian officials because
it created massive blocks of Ukrainian settlements.
Only with great difficulty were newcomers
induced to pioneer in new areas to
create new settlement nuclei, thereby fragmenting
Ukrainian settlement and facilitating
assimilation.

Ukrainian settlers resisted placement on the
open prairie since the vast majority were from
the wooded foothill regions on the eastern
flank of the Carpathians and so had no experience
of steppeland agriculture, nor did
they have sufficient capital to contemplate immediate
entry into commercial agriculture.
Instead they chose to occupy wooded lands
that were often marginal in terms of their
long-term agricultural potential but offered a
wide resource base for those bent on selfsu.
ciency and mixed farming. Wood was
seen as a vital resource for building, fencing,
and use as fuel. Long-term economic progress
was sacrificed to secure immediate survival.
Most Ukrainian settlers were dependent on
off-farm work to generate capital for farm development,
and for decades they "worked out"
on threshing crews, railroad construction
gangs, and in regional resource industries.

Ukrainian settlements were also shaped internally
by chain migration. Immigrants from
Galicia, mostly Ukrainian Catholics, settled
separately from those from Bukovyna, who
were mostly Ukrainian Orthodox. Further
groupings by district, village of origin, and
extended family were also common.

The interwar years brought a second,
smaller wave of immigration from Ukraine to
western Canada. Some homesteaded on the
agricultural margins but most gravitated
to the cities, where they joined established
Ukrainian communities. Farm consolidation
and opportunities in urban centers saw Ukrainian
rural communities decline, while the
proportion of Ukrainians in the parkland
cities of Winnipeg, Saskatoon, and Edmonton
increased dramatically. The postwar years saw
a third wave of Ukrainian immigration into
Canada, of which a small proportion gravitated
to Prairie cities. The Ukrainian community
still reflects its origins in its internal
divisions on the basis of religious affiliation,
political orientation, and, to some extent,
time of immigration.
