VIAL, PEDRO (CA. 1746-1814)

Born in Lyons, France, around 1746, Pedro
(Pierre) Vial was one of the earliest European
explorers and trailblazers on the Southern
Plains. From 1787 to 1809 he served as a guide,
interpreter, negotiator, and pathfinder in the
Spanish Borderlands. Little is known of Vial's
early life, but by the early 1770s he was probably
trapping on the Missouri River. During
the 1770s he lived periodically with various
Southern Plains Indians, plying his trade as a
gunsmith. Vial's relationship with Plains Indian
tribes would help him during his many
journeys across the Plains in later years.

Vial made his first trip across the Plains
in 1786–87, when Texas governor Domingo
Cebello commissioned him to find a route between
the Spanish provincial capitals of San
Antonio, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Vial left San Antonio on October 4, 1786, with
a single companion and a packhorse. The pair
headed north and then followed the Red and
Canadian Rivers across the Plains, reaching
Santa Fe on May 26, 1787. Although the trail
he established was not a direct route and
would be rerouted the following year, Vial was
the first European to travel overland between
the two settlements.

Using Santa Fe as a home base after 1787,
Vial traversed the Plains on numerous occasions
in the service of Spain. In 1788, for
example, he blazed a trail from Santa Fe
to Natchitoches (Louisiana). Concerned with
American activity in the trans-Mississippi region,
New Mexico governor Fernando de la
Concha assigned Vial in 1792 to find a route
from Santa Fe to St. Louis. He and two companions
left Santa Fe on May 21, crossing the
Plains via the Canadian, Arkansas, and Kansas
Rivers; much of this route comprised the later
Santa Fe Trail. On his return trip, Vial went up
the Missouri River to the mouth of the Little
Nemaha River (present-day Nebraska) where
he established relations with the Pawnee Indians.
Between 1795 and 1806 he visited Pawnee
territory at least four times: in 1795 the
Spanish government sent him to negotiate
a peace treaty between the Pawnees and Comanches,
and in 1805 he went back to find out
about the Lewis and Clark expedition. Vial
apparently retired from government service in
1809 and settled permanently in Santa Fe. He
did not marry and had no children. Pedro Vial
died there in October 1814.
