CENTER FOR GREAT PLAINS STUDIES AT EMPORIA STATE UNIVERSITY

The Center for Great Plains Studies, officially
sanctioned at Emporia State University by the
Kansas board of regents in 1977, was conceived
by history professor Patrick O'Brien some
three years earlier. The center, established
with the assistance of a grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities, has a
three-part mandate: to offer academic programs,
to promote public service activities,
and to foster and support research on all aspects
of the people, culture, and land of the
Great Plains, from Texas to Canada. The ultimate
goal of this mandate is to increase awareness,
understanding, and appreciation of the
Great Plains.

From the beginning, pedagogy has been
a major function of the center. Courses on
Great Plains topics from a variety of disciplines
in the arts, humanities, and sciences
were developed and continue to be offered,
both on campus and on location. Particular
emphasis has been on literature and folklore,
history and the social sciences, geology, and
the biological sciences. The most innovative
course offering was the Great Plains Semester,
during which students devoted an entire semester
to study of the history, anthropology,
and literature of the Great Plains, combining
classroom instruction with field trips to six
Plains states. Offering seminars and summer
courses on Plains topics for elementary and
secondary teachers is an ongoing activity
of the center. The center publishes and distributes
Tales out of School, which contains
pedagogical topics and suggestions for public
school teachers.

In the area of public service the Center for
Great Plains Studies has hosted presentations
by scholars from around the nation and as far
away as Australia. It also cooperates with local
arts agencies in sponsoring exhibits and performances
by Plains artists. "Plains Talk,"
a series of public service announcements, is
made available to radio stations in the Great
Plains, and the center has produced national
awardâ€“winning programs for local-access cable
television. The center also supports a
Friends of the Plains organization, comprised
of both academics and community members.

In addition to Tales out of School and the
Great Plains Newsletter, the Center for Great
Plains Studies publishes a multidisciplinary
scholarly journal, Heritage of the Great Plains,
whose contents range from ethnobotany, to
original historical source materials, to literary
criticism, to comparative studies of grasslands
in other parts of the world.
