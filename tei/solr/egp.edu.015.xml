DISTANCE EDUCATION

Distance education is characterized by a physical
separation between learner and teacher
or learner and institution. The Great Plains
proved to be an ideal setting for the development
of distance education programs owing
to its large area and small population.

The earliest form of distance education in
the Great Plains was that of faculty members
from land-grant institutions traveling around
their states by horse or rail to offer instruction
to residents. In the 1890s correspondence education
programs, first pioneered by a private
institution, the University of Chicago, began
developing at major state universities in the
Midwest. By World War I correspondence was
the dominant form of distance education in
the Great Plains.

Practitioners of distance education took advantage
of new technologies as they emerged:
radio in the 1920s, television in the 1950s, satellite
delivery in the 1980s, and computerbased
instruction in the 1990s. As each delivery
technology emerged, it was incorporated
into the overall strategy of distance education.
Rather than succeeding generations of
technology replacing prior technologies, new
technologies added to the delivery arsenal
available to practitioners.

Although the first distance education efforts
were aimed at the postsecondary marketplace,
lifelong learning was always an important
concern. Noncredit courses covering
everything from the arts, to horticulture, to
various trades and skills were offered, regardless
of the decade or the technology. In the
1990s one of the greatest areas of growth, in
terms of both programs and users, was in the
elementary and secondary education arena.
