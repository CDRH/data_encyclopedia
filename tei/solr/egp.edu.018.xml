FRONTIER COLLEGE

Conceived in protest more than a century ago,
Frontier College is Canada's oldest national
adult literacy organization. At the dawn of the
twentieth century the factories, mines, farms,
and railways that were shaping Canada's future
required an army of workers. Immigrants
poured into the country, many often poor, uneducated,
and illiterate. Alfred Fitzpatrick, a
former Presbyterian minister from Pictou,
Nova Scotia, decided to take literacy and the
advantages of education to the workers. He
recruited university students for his Canadian
Reading Camp Association (later named Frontier
College in 1919) and sent them to isolated
locations to labor with the workers during the
day and to teach them at night. They became
known as laborer-teachers. Male laborer-teachers
worked on steel gangs and section
crews for the Canadian National Railway,
while women laborer-teachers worked alongside
Prairie women during the grain harvests.
Whatever work they did, they brought with
them literacy and, in some cases, social reform.

After World War I Frontier College was authorized
by the Canadian government to
grant university degrees, making it Canada's
only "national university." By the 1930s
the degree-granting concept had been terminated,
and laborer-teachers worked in Relief
Camps for the unemployed and later, during
World War II, on the Alaska Highway. By the
1950s and 1960s, as sophisticated machinery
reduced the need for manual labor, Frontier
College turned to community development
and projects with Canada's First Nations. In
1977 Frontier College was recognized by the
United Nations with the unesco prize for education
and literacy. Beat the Street, a literacy
program of street people working with street
people, was begun in Regina and Winnipeg in
the 1980s.

Since 1987 Canadian university students
calling themselves Frontier College associates
have been working in Alberta, Saskatchewan,
and Manitoba to address issues of literacy and
poverty. The Student Centred Individualized
Learning Programme (SCIL), developed by
Frontier College, has allowed learners across
the country to set up and monitor their own
programs. Frontier College continues to respond
to the challenge that founder Alfred
Fitzpatrick made to all Canadians: to take education
to those who do not have it, whoever
and wherever they may be.
