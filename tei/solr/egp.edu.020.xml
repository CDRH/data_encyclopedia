INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS, CANADA


Father and children attending Qu'Appelle (Saskatchewan) Industrial School, ca. 1900


The modern phase of Canada's residential
schools system for First Nations children
emerged in the 1880s in the Prairie Provinces,
and several of the institutions would continue
to exist in that region after the government
of Canada decided to phase out the institutions
in 1969. Missionaries and colonial governments
had experimented with boarding
schools for Native children as early as the
French colonial regime of the seventeenth
century, and other custodial institutions were
initiated by Protestant missionary organizations
in eighteenth-century colonial New
Brunswick and early-nineteenth-century Upper
Canada (Ontario). However, the modern
era of residential schooling in Canada began
in the Prairies in 1883 as a direct consequence
of the treaties that Canada had negotiated
with the First Nations between 1871 and 1877.
The system began slowly in the Prairies in
1883, spread to British Columbia in the 1890s,
and expanded to the far North and the northerly
regions of Ontario and Quebec in the
twentieth century. At the height of the residential
school system in the 1920s, more than
half of the eighty institutions were located in
the three Prairie Provinces.

Indian residential schools were joint operations
of the federal government and the major
Christian churches. The government authorized
the creation of schools, provided partial
funding for their operation, specified curricula
and standards of care, and, in general,
oversaw their operation as a system. The day-to-
day running of the institutions was in the
hands of the churches, with approximately
60 percent of the schools operated by the Roman
Catholic Church (mainly through the
Oblates of Mary Immaculate and female religious
orders), about 30 percent by the Anglican
Church, and the remainder by the Methodists
and Presbyterians. (The Methodists and
most Presbyterians united with the Congregationalists
in 1925 to form the United Church of
Canada.) Church missionary bodies concentrated
on selecting personnel, particularly
principals, subject to the approval of the government.
A constant source of tension between
missionaries and the government was
the level of state funding, which was never
adequate to cover most of the costs of the
schools. The various churches also tended to
regard one another with denominational hostility,
resulting in a competition for recruits to
populate their schools.

The strong emphasis placed by the missionaries
on sectarian attitudes toward denominational
rivals and the aggressive proselytization
of the students under their care
constituted but one of the many grievances
that both residential school students and their
families had with the system. Inadequate government
funding, especially from the 1890s to
the latter part of the 1950s (the government
began to improve financing after 1956), led
to overwork of the students and inadequate
care in diet, accommodation, clothing, and
amenities such as recreational equipment.
The root of the funding problem was government
reluctance to spend much on the First
Nations, principally because Canadian society
placed little value on Native peoples, and the
fact that the per capita funding mechanism
that was used induced missionaries to place
a greater emphasis on keeping student places
in the schools filled than on providing adequate
care.

Since, like American schools, Canadian residential
schools operated until the 1950s on
the half-day system, the administrators had
ample occasion to overwork the students. The
half-day system theoretically taught both usable
job skills and rudimentary academic
learning by having students in the classroom
half the day and engaged in work in fields,
barns, kitchens, and workrooms the other
half. In reality, the half-day system proved a
means of extracting student labor to keep the
underfunded schools running. Besides excessive
work and ethnocentrically focused religion,
the schools stimulated opposition by
providing inadequate care at the best of times
and serious physical, emotional, and sexual
abuse at the worst. These ills, in conjunction
with the obvious fact that the schools were
not succeeding as pedagogical, evangelical,
or vocational-training operations, provoked
strong and organized First Nations opposition
by the 1940s. After much hesitation, largely
caused by vigorous Roman Catholic opposition
to closure, the government decided in
1969 to phase out the schools. Some schools
persisted into the 1980s, and a few continued
to operate under First Nations control until
the 1990s.

In the twenty-first century Canada's residential schools are a festering legal and political
problem for Canadians. By the end of 2000
more than 6,200 individual lawsuits involving
some 7,200 individuals had been filed against
the government and, in some cases, the missionaries;
they allege abuse, both physical and
sexual, and cultural loss. The number of suits
continues to increase weekly. One law firm in
the Prairie Provinces is handling over half
the suits.
