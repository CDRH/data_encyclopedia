LAND-GRANT UNIVERSITIES

The Morrill Act, signed into law by Abraham
Lincoln on July 2, 1862, set aside public lands
for the establishment of land-grant universities.
The act came from a movement favoring
practical scientific and industrial education
for American working classes. Led by
Congressman Justin Morrill of Vermont, the
land-grant idea emerged as a reaction against
the classical curriculum that dominated traditional
institutions. Sparked by advancements
in science prior to 1850, reformers sought a
system that could build upon the resourcefulness
of industrial classes. Morrill, himself the
son of a blacksmith, believed in better educational
opportunities for the children of artisans,
farmers, and laborers. He believed that
a true democracy meant educating everyone,
not just those who sought careers in law, politics,
and the ministry. Morrill was also influenced
by a crisis of declining agricultural
productivity on American farms. He learned
about the advances in scientific agriculture in
Europe and believed that similar practices
could be applied in the United States, especially
as it expanded westward into new agricultural
areas. The Morrill Act was passed the
same year as the Homestead Act, thus further
encouraging agricultural development in the
Great Plains.

President James Buchanan had vetoed Morrill's
first land-grant bill in 1857 on the grounds
that higher education should be left to the
states. Morrill was also hindered by southerners'
skepticism of the expansion of federal
powers and the bill's perceived favoritism toward
northern states and territories. After the
Civil War began, Morrill introduced the bill
again in 1861 to a more receptive, northern
Congress. Morrill set aside for every state the
sale of 30,000 acres for each representative and
senator to endow and support land-grant universities.
The act allowed for teaching a classical
curriculum, but the emphasis was on agriculture,
mechanical arts (engineering), and
military tactics. Ironically, western states that
later benefited from the Morrill Act were some
of its loudest detractors in the beginning.
Westerners feared that all of the public lands
would be taken from their states. Kansas senator
James Lane offered an amendment that
limited the land claimed in any one state to
one million acres. With that amendment, the
bill was passed.

During the Civil War, only two states, Iowa
in 1862 and Kansas in 1863, passed land-grant
resolutions. Not until after 1865 could most
states refocus their attention on higher education.
Kansas was the first Plains state to take
on the conditions of the Morrill Act, with the
Kansas State Agricultural College (Manhattan),
founded in 1863. Nebraska was next,
with the University of Nebraska (Lincoln),
founded in 1869. Other Plains states and territories
followed, with Texas A&amp;M University
(College Station) in 1876; Colorado State University
(Fort Collins) in 1879; South Dakota
State University (Brookings) in 1881; the University
of Wyoming (Laramie) in 1887; North
Dakota State University (Fargo) in 1890; and
Oklahoma State University (Stillwater) in
1890. Since the land-grant universities were
founded to be the agriculture and mechanical
schools, some states established separate state
universities with an emphasis on liberal arts.
Kansas, Oklahoma, and South Dakota, for example,
each established two universities, one
land-grant and one state university. Nebraska
and Wyoming combined both the land-grant
purpose and liberal arts into one consolidated
university.

The land-grant curriculum focused on
practical, scientific education. Besides mechanical
arts, the curriculum could include
agriculture, pharmacology, and, for women,
domestic economy. Military training was
also required of male students, and many of
those soldiers and officers later served in the
Spanish-American War and both world wars.
In the Great Plains, institutions focused on
agricultural studies, which included efficient
crop production, animal science, dairying,
and plant biology. In the twentieth century,
agriculture science expanded to include genetics,
hybridization, fertilizer production,
and veterinary medicine. Women were included
in the land-grant mission through domestic
or home economics programs, because
efficient farms also needed educated farm
wives.

Land-grant universities were progressive
not only in their approach to practical education
but also because they admitted women
and people of color; all students received free
tuition and subsidized rail travel. These institutions
struggled financially and academically
before 1900, and some critics claimed
that young people never returned to farm
work after attending college, thus defeating
the very purpose of the land-grant mission.
Even if that was the case, land-grant institutions
continued to reach out to rural, agricultural
populations. In 1887 Congress passed the
Hatch Act to stimulate research in agriculture
science through the creation of experiment
stations at which students and professors
could apply new knowledge toward efficient
farm production. Students even lived and
worked on model farms that allowed them to
use their classroom education in a working
and productive farm setting. The Hatch Act
expanded the role of land-grant universities
through research contributions to agricultural
science that continue to this day.

In 1890 the second Morrill Act was passed,
providing additional land-grant endowments.
States that made distinctions of race in admissions
could not receive the funds, so the act
allowed for the creation of separate land-grant
universities for blacks. The founding of many
all-black colleges after 1890 included two in
the Great Plains: Prairie View a&amp;m University
in Texas and Langston University in Oklahoma.
All other Plains land-grant institutions
continued to admit black students. It was not
until 1994 that Congress passed the Equity
in Educational Land-Grant Status Act, which
created land-grant colleges for Native American
populations. Plains states benefited most
from this, with a majority of Indian landgrant
colleges located in South Dakota (four),
North Dakota (five), Montana (seven), Nebraska
(one), and Kansas (one).

The desire to extend land-grant education
to a broader population led to the creation of
the Cooperative Extension Service as part of
the Smith-Lever Act of 1914. Because practical
education was still unavailable to many, cooperative
extension sought to disseminate information
to a wider population, especially in
agriculture, home economics, and rural energy.
Extension programs especially benefited
Plains states, with their large geographic areas
and scattered rural populations. Today, extension
programs continue to take education to
distant farm areas.

In the twentieth century, land-grant universities
expanded their missions beyond the agricultural
scope of the nineteenth century. Not
strictly agriculture and mechanics schools
anymore, land-grant universities also developed
arts, humanities, and social science programs.
Graduate programs were established
in most departments on land-grant campuses.
Further, land-grant universities endeavored to
carry on in their purpose of providing public,
democratic, and practical education to
a larger population. Broad admissions standards,
low tuition costs, cooperative extension
programs, and agricultural experiment stations
are some of the methods used by landgrant
institutions to make education widely
available to many in the Great Plains.
