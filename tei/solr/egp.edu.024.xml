LORENTINO, DOROTHY SUNRISE (b. 1912)

Dorothy Sunrise Lorentino opened the door
for public school education for Native Americans
and educated a nation. The extraordinary
contributions to education of this Lawton,
Oklahoma, native began with a battle. At
the age of six she was denied access to the
Cache Public Schools because of her heritage
as a Comanche Indian. She and her parents
made a twenty-mile train ride to Lawton,
Oklahoma, where her father sued the school
district for refusing to admit Native American
children to public schools. Lorentino's father
won the lawsuit in 1918. Prior to this ruling, all
Native American children were required by
law to attend only Bureau of Indian Affairs
schools.

Lorentino later graduated from the Indian
boarding school at Chilocco and earned a
bachelor's degree from Northeastern Oklahoma
A&amp;M in Talequah in 1938 and a master's
degree from the University of Oregon in 1947.
Before retiring in 1972, Lorentino taught special
education for thirty-four years on reservations
in Arizona and New Mexico and later in
the public schools of Salem and Tillamook,
Oregon. Following her retirement, she continued
teaching by substituting at public
schools, and she taught the Comanche tribal
language and songs to members of her tribe.

Lorentino earned many awards throughout
her career as a teacher. In 1997 she became the
first Oklahoman and Native American to be
inducted into the National Teachers Hall of
Fame. Other honors include the National Indian
Education Association's Elder of the Year,
the Delta Kappa Gamma Society Lifetime
Award, and Outstanding Woman of Comanche
County. In 1996 Cache High School initiated
the Dorothy Sunrise Lorentino Award to
be presented annually to the Native American
graduating senior who best exemplifies the
qualities for which Lorentino stands.
