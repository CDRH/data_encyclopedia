WOMEN IN HIGHER EDUCATION

Women felt the importance of higher education
almost as soon as the first settlers arrived
in the Great Plains. Plains immigrants
brought with them democratic ideals rooted
in the need for public education. By the late
1840s and 1850s only a few scattered communities
in the eastern Plains had established
primary schools. After the Civil War, increased
Plains settlement prompted more
school building. Public education was not
yet compulsory in the United States, but communities
took the initiative of organizing
schools. Local districts often hired teachers
from among the young, unmarried daughters
of homesteaders, especially in the wake of the
post–Civil War shortage of male teachers.
Since new teachers were often young and uneducated
themselves, the need for institutionalized
teacher training arose early.

The first opportunities for women in higher
education emerged as part of this need for
teacher training. In rural areas, teachers had
little or no access to institutional education,
so for Plains women, "normal" training and
teacher institutes provided an early opportunity
for higher education. Normal schools
and teacher-training institutes, founded in the
United States since the early nineteenth century,
went west with the settlers. However, it
was not until the late 1860s that Plains states
and territories established normal schools
such as Nebraska State Normal School in Peru
(1867). By the 1870s counties throughout the
Plains were holding teacher institutes during
the summer months for educating schoolteachers.
Little better than high schools, these
institutes offered a form of higher education
to rural women. Also called county institutes,
by the 1890s they became union normals and/or junior normal schools after many counties
were brought under one, consolidated summer
training session. It was mainly women
who attended these institutes because the
teaching profession became increasingly feminized
in the late nineteenth century.

Around 1910 many Plains states consolidated
normal training under state jurisdiction
with the establishment of state teachers colleges.
States then assumed more control over
these colleges by incorporating them within
the state university systems by the 1930s. After
World War II education standards began to
require a bachelor's degree for teacher certification.
Today, many women college students
obtain teaching certificates through bachelor
programs in primary and secondary education
at state and land-grant universities, where
they dominate the programs.

University education for women had important
beginnings in the Great Plains. The
Morrill Act of 1862 set aside lands for each state
or territory to establish a university for the
education of the agricultural and industrial
populations. Although coeducation was not
required by the Morrill Act, by 1890 every state
included the admission of women in its landgrant
charter. The first Plains land-grant institution
to admit women was Kansas State
Agricultural College (Manhattan), founded in
1863. Others followed: the University of Nebraska
(Lincoln) in 1869; Texas A&amp;M University
(College Station) in 1876; Colorado State
University (Fort Collins) in 1879; South Dakota
State University (Brookings) in 1881; the
University of Wyoming (Laramie) in 1886;
North Dakota State University (Fargo) in 1890;
and Oklahoma State University (Stillwater) in
1890. By 1890 coeducation was a recognized
norm in Great Plains higher education.

Since coeducation was not yet overwhelmingly
accepted in America, the admission of
women students was an important experiment
for Plains women. Women's education
fit easily into the land-grant mission because
agricultural populations included farmers'
wives and daughters as well as those single
women who farmed for themselves. Domestic
economy training, later known as home economics,
provided for the making of scientific
farm wives. Land-grant universities in the
Plains were some of the first in the world to
offer professional domestic economy training
to female students. Kansas Agricultural College
in Manhattan, later Kansas State University, offered a domestic economy department
in 1871, the first of its kind at a public institution
in America. Other land-grant institutions
were sometimes slow to establish a domestic
economy department, instead offering
women students the traditional, classicalbased
curriculum of Latin, Greek, history, and
literature. By the 1890s, however, most domestic
economy departments were firmly in place.

Domestic economy programs began with
the basic courses of cooking and sewing. As
departments expanded, courses included nutrition,
sanitation, hygiene, air circulation,
plumbing, dairying, poultry, dressmaking,
millinery, child care, nursing, and horticulture
or house gardening. What made landgrant
universities unique is that men and
women students together studied basic science
courses like chemistry and biology. In
the upper-class years, students divided into
separate coursework based upon gender: mechanical
arts (engineering) and agriculture
for men and domestic economy for women.
While domestic economy courses built upon
the scientific foundation women had received
with their male colleagues, the practical application
of that science was directed toward
women's roles as housewives. For instance,
chemistry was applied toward the study of nutrition
for healthy meal preparation. Although
most land-grant women used their
training for domestic purposes, a few women
built upon their undergraduate backgrounds
in chemistry and biology to pursue graduate
degrees in those sciences.

While higher education for women in the
Plains centered mostly around domestic economy,
many women chose to pursue the traditional
classical curriculum. Since the landgrant
universities were founded for scientific
training, some states established separate state
universities with an emphasis on liberal arts.
For example, the University of Kansas, the
University of Oklahoma, the University of
South Dakota, and the University of North
Dakota were all founded as liberal arts alternatives
to their states' land-grant universities.
At these state universities, women could study
history and literature and receive teacher
training. Other states like Nebraska and Wyoming
combined both the land-grant purpose
and liberal arts into one consolidated university
where women could choose between domestic
arts and liberal arts. Women like Willa
Cather at the University of Nebraska chose the
literary option instead of the domestic arts
program. Other important women who made
names for themselves at universities in the
Plains included Grace Hebard as a historian at
the University of Wyoming and Rachel Lloyd
as a botanist at the University of Nebraska.

In the Canadian Plains, women entered
higher education in various private colleges
and seminaries for women prior to 1900.
Provinces founded public coeducational universities
after 1900 with the establishment
of the University of Manitoba (Winnipeg)
in 1900, the University of Alberta (Edmonton)
in 1908, and the University of Saskatchewan
(Saskatoon), which opened with fifty-eight
men and twelve women students in 1909.
These Canadian universities had programs
similar to the American state universities for
studying liberal arts, and most had established
domestic economy programs for women by
the 1920s.

Native American and African American
women also found opportunities for higher
education in the Plains. Since most of the landgrant
institutions were open to anyone regardless
of race, a few nonwhite women attended.
Most Native women entered all-female seminaries
and academies, like the Chickasaw Female
Indian Academy in Oklahoma. These
academies provided language, domestic economy,
and teacher training for Native women. A
few Native American women with means went
east for higher education, like Susan and Marguerite
LaFlesche of the Omaha nation, who
attended the Hampton Normal and Agricultural
Institute in Virginia. Black women who
could not find adequate training in the Plains
also enrolled in eastern universities. By the late
1890s, in order to accommodate the need for
African American women teachers at segregated
Plains schools, Texas and Oklahoma
founded black-only normal schools. The second
Morrill Act of 1890 created land-grant
universities for African Americans, including
Prairie View A&amp;M University in Texas and the
Colored Agricultural and Normal University
in Oklahoma, today known as Langston University,
where women could obtain domestic
economy and liberal arts education.

The history of women's experiences in
Great Plains higher education is an especially
important one to the overall history of women's
education in America. Many Plains institutions,
both land-grant and state universities,
were some of the first public institutions
in America and in the world to be coeducational.
Further, women's entrance into scientific
studies like chemistry and biology was
pioneered in the Plains, especially in landgrant
education. Enrollment for women students
in the nineteenth century hovered at
around 25 to 30 percent of all university students,
and that percentage gradually increased
through the twentieth century. Today, female
enrollment at Plains universities is just under
50 percent, with a higher representation for
women in specific areas of study such as home
economics, family sciences, history, English,
music, and art. Women are still underrepresented
in fields such as agriculture, veterinary
science, engineering, math, and biological sciences
as well as in chemistry. Plains universities
are now seeking to increase female enrollment
in graduate programs, law schools,
and medical and dental programs. In 2001
at the University of Nebraska, for example,
women constitute 53 percent of all graduate
students and 43 percent of the students in law
and architecture but only 32 percent of the
dental and medical students. With recruiting
programs, scholarship opportunities, teacher
training, distance education, and collegiate
preparation in high schools, Plains women
continue to expand their presence in Great
Plains higher education.
