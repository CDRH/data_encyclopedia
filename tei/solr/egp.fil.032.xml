INCIDENT AT OGLALA

Incident at Oglala DVD Cover
     

Incident at Oglala is a 1992 documentary detailing
the June 26, 1975, slayings of FBI special
agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams in the
Jumping Bull compound near Oglala, South
Dakota, and the subsequent conviction of
Leonard Peltier for the crime. Although James
Eagle, Dino Butler, Bob Robideau, and Peltier
were charged with the shootings, Peltier was
the only one convicted. Directed by Michael
Apted and produced and narrated by Robert
Redford, the film provides substantial background
on the period of high tension on the
Pine Ridge Reservation immediately following
Wounded Knee II. The film clearly suggests
the unscrupulous lengths to which the
FBI and government prosecutors went in order
to get a conviction. Peltier, who had fled to
Canada, was extradited based on sworn affidavits
that government prosecutors later admitted
to be coerced fabrications.

Besides giving a feel for the conditions on
Pine Ridge and an account of the incident, the
film includes interviews and statements with
key players and witnesses, including Peltier,
American Indian Movement members Dennis
Banks and Russell Means, William Kunstler,
who served as attorney for Butler and appellant
attorney for Peltier, and Myrtle Poor Bear,
who claims she was coerced into changing her
affidavit in order to extradite Peltier. Two assistant
U.S. attorneys and one U.S. attorney
speak for the government, but no FBI agents
speak due to Bureau policy.

The Peltier case is ongoing. Peltier has become
a celebrated example of someone considered
by many to be a political prisoner. The
incidents surrounding the story were also
loosely used in Apted's theatrical film Thunderheart
(1992).
