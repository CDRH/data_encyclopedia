NOLTE, NICK (b. 1942)

Nick Nolte
    

Born in Omaha, Nebraska, on February 8,
1941, Nick Nolte was a star athlete in high
school who won a football scholarship to Arizona
State University. Over the next several
years he drifted in and out of numerous college
programs before abandoning plans for a
professional football career.

While studying at the Pasadena Playhouse,
Nolte came to the attention of a drama coach
who encouraged him to study at Stella Adler's
Academy. Believing that the coasts were over-populated
with talented actors, Nolte sought
opportunities to develop his acting skills
with various regional theater companies. He
worked for more than a decade with companies
in Denver, Chicago, and Minneapolis.
After a few minor television roles in the early
1970s, Nolte landed the pivotal role of his career
(Rich Man, Poor Man, ABC [1976]), which
garnered him an Emmy nomination.

Hollywood noticed his phenomenal audience
appeal, and Nolte began regular film
work. Although much in demand as a romantic
lead (The Deep, 1977; Prince of Tides, 1991),
Nick Nolte has almost always shunned purely
commercial fare in favor of roles that examine
the darker, more troubling elements of the human
spirit. As a result, he is more often seen as
a complex and often threatening antagonist (Q&amp;A, 1990) than a romantic leading man. Even
his more romantic turns (as in Afterglow, 1997)
examine a tortured psyche with enormous
depth and realism.

One of the most physically intense and
emotionally eloquent contemporary American
actors, Nolte continues to produce critically
acclaimed performances (Affliction, 1998;
The Thin Red Line, 1999).
