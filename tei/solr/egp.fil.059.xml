SAUNDERS, RUSSELL (1919-2001)

Headshot of Russell Saunders
    

Born on a farm near Winnipeg, Manitoba, on
May 21, 1919, Russell M. Saunders repeatedly
risked his life as perhaps the greatest movie
stuntman of Hollywood's halcyon days. As a
child he was fascinated by the acrobats in traveling
circuses, and he worked on his acrobatic
skills until he had achieved Canadian championships
in diving and gymnastics. After
being rejected by the Canadian Air Force because
he was color-blind, he moved to California.
There he quickly found his way to Muscle
Beach in Santa Monica, where acrobats and
body builders performed and paraded. Even
in his later years he spent much of his time on
the beach, giving free gymnastics lessons to
children.

But it was in the movie business that Saunders
made his name. He appeared in more
than a hundred movies, doubling for stars
such as Alan Ladd, Robert Cummings, and
Gene Kelly. He was particularly revered by his
peers for his ability to capture the exact mannerisms
of the stars as he performed the dangerous
feats they were unable to do. In The Three Musketeers (1948), for example, he
jumped from a rooftop, caught hold of a flag,
and, as it ripped, swung on the shreds through
an open window. In another film as Richard
Widmark's double he leaped off a fifty-foot
cliff, breaking his arm on a rock in the water.
Saunders was also in the climactic fight scene
in Shane (1953), unknown to audiences, who
saw only Alan Ladd and his antagonists in the
blur of action. Russell Saunders died in a West
Los Angeles nursing home on May 29, 2001.
