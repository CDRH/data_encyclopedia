WELSCH, ROGER (b. 1936)

Nebraska author and folklorist Roger Lee-
Flack Welsch has as many alter egos as Nebraska
has weather patterns: storyteller, professor,
talk show host, originator and first
president of the Liars Hall of Fame, raconteur,
columnist, Omaha Tribe member, family
man, musician, "that guy in the overalls on
CBS News Sunday Morning," and antique-tractor-
hugging collector. Highly sought after
as a speaker, and best known for his humorous
portrayals of Great Plains characters in
the popular press and media, Welsch also has
a more scholarly side. He has published important
works on tall tales, sod houses, foodways,
round barns, and traditional stories of
the Omaha Tribe, among others. He was formally
adopted into the Omaha's Wind Clan by
tribal elders in 1967.

Born on November 6, 1936, Welsch grew up
in Lincoln, Nebraska, a member of the city's
substantial community of Germans from Russia
(Volga Germans). He attended the University
of Nebraska, earning both a bachelor of
arts (1958) and a master of arts (1960) in German,
and then pursued a growing interest in
folklore by completing graduate work at the
University of Colorado (1962) and at the
Folklore Institute, Indiana University (1963–
65.) Welsch taught folklore and English at
Dana College in Blair, Nebraska, from 1960 to
1964, at Nebraska Wesleyan University in Lincoln
from 1964 to 1973, and at the University
of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL) from 1973 to 1988.
He remains a unl adjunct faculty member.
Welsch has published many scholarly and
popular writings on Great Plains folklore.

He has also played an important role in
promoting Great Plains folk traditions by coordinating
Nebraska's featured participation
in the Smithsonian Institution's 1975 Festival
of American Folklife, serving on grant panels
for the National Endowment for the Arts
(NEA) Folk Arts Program, and successfully
nominating Nebraskan Albert Fahlbusch, a
Volga German who makes and plays hammered
dulcimers, for an NEA National Heritage
Fellowship in 1984.

Welsch first came to national prominence,
however, as a result of his successful 1972 campaign
for a seat on the Lancaster County (Nebraska)
Weed Control Authority board on a
"pro-weed ticket," reducing the number of native
plants defined as weeds. Charles Kuralt,
who was at that time still conducting his "On
the Road" series for the CBS Evening News, got
wind of the folklorist-politician and invited
Welsch to appear on his show. That meeting
began their long-term friendship and working
relationship. Welsch became nationally known
as the overalls-wearing Nebraska essayist, affably
relating stories–"Postcards from Nebraska"–
of rural and small-town life in the Great
Plains for Kuralt's show, cbs News Sunday
Morning.

Now living with his wife, artist Linda Welsch,
on their tree farm near the small community of
Dannebrog (a "star" of many of the "Postcards
from Nebraska"), Welsch continues his writing,
television, and speaking career. His ability
to prosper by doing what he loves is a good
example of the "can-do" adaptive spirit he celebrates
in the people of the region.
