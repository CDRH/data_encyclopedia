EASTMAN, ELAINE GOODALE (1863-1953)

Elaine Goodale Eastman wrote extensively
about Native Americans, both as a collaborator
with her husband, Dakota physician and
writer Charles Eastman, and under her own
name. Born on October 9, 1863, at Sky Farm in
the Berkshires of Massachusetts, Eastman
wrote poetry as a child, used her literary talents
while a teacher of Sioux at Hampton Institute,
and sent letters and articles to eastern
publications during four years of teaching and
supervising Native schools on the Great Sioux
Reservation from 1886 to 1890.

At Pine Ridge at the time of the Wounded
Knee Massacre, she met and married Dr. Eastman.
Thereupon she sacrificed her own literary
ambition to further the career of her husband
and the cause of his people. When he
had difficulty providing for the family, she encouraged
him to write stories of his Native
childhood, which she edited and published.
Together they produced nine books, most under
his name alone. He became famous as a
writer and lecturer on Native American life,
while she remained anonymous at home in
Massachusetts caring for their six children. In
all this Elaine Eastman exhibited a "feminist
Protestant ethic," whereby all the virtues of
the Protestant ethic–industry, thrift, and
enterprise–were applied to the service of others,
specifically her husband and Native
Americans.

Illness, constant financial problems, and
the death of a daughter increased the strains
on an already troubled marriage, which ended
in 1921. The couple neither divorced nor reconciled.
Elaine Eastman continued to write
until she was almost ninety, drawing material
from her own childhood and marriage, as well
as from her experience living with and teaching
the Sioux. Although her posthumously
published memoirs provide a sympathetic
and readable account of Sioux life in the 1880s,
none of her seven books achieved the success
of those published under her husband's name.
Elaine Eastman died on December 22, 1953, at
Hadley, Massachusetts.
