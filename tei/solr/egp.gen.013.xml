FIELD MATRONS

Field matrons worked for the U.S. Bureau of
Indian Affairs (BIA) between 1890 and 1938
in a campaign designed to introduce Native
American women to Victorian, middle-class
culture. Like the destruction of the collective
land base by allotment, the disruption of families
by the removal of children to Indian
schools, and the steady diminution of sovereignty
by federal encroachments, the domestic
education of Native American women became,
in the hands of the field matrons, yet
another tool to destroy tribalism. Convinced
that it was possible to "kill the Indian and save
the woman [sic]," the bia looked to the field
matrons to promote assimilation in reservation
communities across the American West.

By the last decades of the nineteenth century,
Canadian and American policymakers
and reform advocates active in Indian affairs
agreed that wholesale "civilization" was the
only way to ensure the survival of those remaining
Native populations located in the
western provinces and states. Only in the
United States, though, did a woman-specific
assimilation strategy develop. To teach Indian
women "to respect and love and seek the ways
of White women," the BIA worked with members
of Congress, reformers, and missionary
activists to create the field matron program.

Sent into the field in 1890, the field matrons
eventually worked in nearly every tribal community
in the Great Plains, as well as across
the West. Those women first employed by the
bia in the late nineteenth century exemplified
the era's "certified civilizers." Caucasian, middle
class, and single, they were imbued with
Christian missionary spirit. As field matrons
they spread among the Indians the American
gospel of cleanliness, godliness, corsets, femininity,
homebound domesticity, and woman's
proper sphere. In the early twentieth century, however, the composition of the group
changed. The American women becoming
field matrons after 1900 coupled their reformist
ambition to "do good" with their personal
desire to "do well" financially as BIA employees.
From the end of World War I until
1938, women motivated by economic gain
rather than rescue dominated the field matron
corps.

While the bia heartily encouraged Native
women to become advocates for assimilation
in their homes and communities, it only reluctantly
included them as full partners in
the field matron program. The same ethnocentrism
that skewed American and Canadian
perspectives on Indian traditionalism resulted
in restrictions on the employment of "civilized"
tribal women. The BIA rarely accepted
Native adoptions of the "American way" as
trustworthy because, at base, it was deeply
suspicious of the very process of cultural
change it hoped to promote. The agency restricted
tribal women to the position of assistant
field matron and only appointed them
between 1895 and 1905. Most of these women
served in tribal communities located in the
Great Plains.

The decision to phase out the field matron
program in the 1930s reflected both the waning
significance of Victorian domesticity and the
desperate need in reservation communities for
medical expertise. Appalling public health
conditions plagued Native Americans in both
the United States and Canada during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In
the United States, tuberculosis and trachoma
ran rampant; infant and child morbidity and
mortality robbed tribal communities of their
future generations; and destitution revealed itself
in malnutrition and hopelessness. Field
matrons struggled to adapt their positions by
teaching seminars on epidemic diseases and
prenatal care instead of homemaking. Their
efforts saved lives but also led the BIA to conclude
that trained nurses were more valuable
than assimilation advocates. After 1938 field
nurses replaced field matrons as "civilization"
took a backseat to Indian public health education
and care in the United States.
