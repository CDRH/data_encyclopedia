HOOKER, EVELYN (1907-1996)

Born in North Platte, Nebraska, on September
2, 1907, Evelyn Hooker, a pioneer in the
scientific study of male homosexuality, revolutionized
the psychological establishment's
understanding of homosexuality during the
second half of the twentieth century. Her research
and activism contributed significantly
to the modern gay rights movement.

Evelyn Gentry, the sixth of nine children of
poor farming parents, was born in her grandmother's
home, close by Col. William F. (Buffalo
Bill) Cody's, barely eluding the Sandhills
sod house in which her family had recently
been dwelling. She spent her youth on small
farms in northeastern Colorado until her
education-minded mother, who had migrated
to Nebraska by prairie schooner, moved the
family to Sterling in the Colorado Plains,
where Evelyn could attend a large and progressive
high school. There her teachers encouraged
her to apply to the University of
Colorado, which she entered on a tuition
scholarship in 1924, eventually majoring in
psychology.

After completing her master's degree at
Boulder in 1930, she pursued doctoral work at
Johns Hopkins University, where she earned
her doctorate in psychology in 1932. After several
years of teaching at small colleges, a bout
with tuberculosis, and study and travel in Germany
(where she witnessed Nazi repression
firsthand), she applied for a position in psychology
at UCLA, becoming a research associate
through the extension division in 1939. She
taught and conducted her research there until
1970, and then pursued private practice for
another decade.

Prompted by a gay former student, Hooker
began preliminary research with male homosexuals
in the late 1940s. In 1953 she applied
to the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH) for a stipend to undertake a comparative
study of adjustment in nonclinical
homosexual and heterosexual men, which to
her surprise was granted, despite McCarthy-era
attacks on homosexuals, ubiquitous sodomy
statutes, and orthodox psychiatry's conviction
that adult homosexual behavior was
a serious mental disorder producing severe
maladjustment.

Contradicting firmly entrenched psychiatric
dogma, Hooker's findings, which were
presented at meetings of the American Psychological
Association and published from
the mid-1950s onward in a succession of rigorously
researched articles, demonstrated that
there was no distinct male homosexual personality
type, that homosexual men were no
more inherently abnormal in psychological
makeup than their heterosexual counterparts,
and that the results of standard projective tests
and attitude scales (Rorschachs, Thematic Apperception
Tests, and the like) of wellmatched
heterosexual and homosexual men
were, in terms of social adjustment, indistinguishable
to expert clinicians. (Other researchers,
replicating Hooker's experiments,
have repeatedly turned up identical results.)
In 1961 she was encouraged to continue her
empirical studies of homosexual men through
an nimh Research Career Award.

Years later Hooker was appointed to head
the nimh Task Force on Homosexuality.
Among the recommendations of its 1969 report
were increased funding for empirical scientific
research into homosexuality, repeal of
laws criminalizing homosexual acts between
consenting adults, and an end to job discrimination
based on sexual orientation. In 1973,
largely as a result of Hooker's sustained research,
members of the American Psychiatric
Association voted to remove homosexuality as
a pathological condition from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
Two years later the American Psychological
Association took a similar stance, and since
then, in the spirit of Hooker's groundbreaking
work, has become a leading force in the movement
for social equality for gay men, lesbians,
bisexuals, and transgendered persons. In 1991
the American Psychological Association honored
Hooker's "Distinguished Contribution
to Psychology in the Public Interest." The University
of Chicago's Evelyn Hooker Center for
Gay and Lesbian Mental Health was named in
her memory.

Evelyn Hooker died in Santa Monica, California,
on November 18, 1996.
