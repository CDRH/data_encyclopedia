MCCLUNG, NELLIE (1873-1951)

Nellie Letitia McClung was an internationally
known writer, platform speaker, feminist, and
social activist whose passion for social transformation
in the service of justice was equaled
only by the witty, engaging manner in which
she delivered her message. A woman of humble
beginnings, she went on to achieve tremendous
social and political notoriety, and by
the end of her life was one of Canada's bestknown
personages, lovingly known as "Our
Nell."

McClung was born Nellie Mooney to a
poor farming family in Grey County, Ontario,
on October 20, 1873. Lured by the promise of
homesteading, her family relocated to Millford,
a small settlement in southwestern Manitoba,
when Nellie was seven. She became a
country schoolteacher by sixteen and was
dreaming of "telling the stories of the common
people" as a writer when she met Annie
McClung, the wife of the new Methodist minister.
Annie combined religious conviction
with a passion for women's suffrage and temperance
activism in a powerful mix that was
both compelling and inspiring to the young
woman. First a role model for Nellie, Annie
became Nellie's mother-in-law in 1896, when
Nellie married her oldest son, Wes. Annie was
responsible for Nellie's entry into the short
story contest that began her formal writing
career, and after the publication of Nellie's
first novel, Sowing Seeds in Danny (1908), she
initiated McClung's speaking career by arranging
a public reading of that Canadian
best-seller in the service of the temperance
cause.

McClung moved to Edmonton, Alberta, in
1914, then relocated to Calgary in 1923. She
used her literature as a pulpit to preach a text
of social change grounded in what she believed
was God's intention for Creation, "the
even chance for everyone." As the campaign
for women's suffrage gathered momentum,
she was increasingly in demand as a platform
speaker, traveling throughout Canada, and in
1916 and 1917 throughout the United States as
well, at the behest of the National American
Woman Suffrage Association. Her oratory
skills were superlative. Gifted with a devastating
wit, she roundly trounced political enemies
like the conservative premier of Manitoba,
Sir Rodmond Roblin, in her speeches,
culminating in the wildly successful "Woman's
Parliament" of 1914. This play of role
reversals, where men ask a government of
women for men's suffrage, is fictionally rendered
in McClung's social gospel novel, Purple Springs (1921).

McClung went on to write sixteen books
(four novels, two novellas, several collections
of short stories and newspaper columns, and a
two-volume autobiography), as well as a syndicated
newspaper column and innumerable
magazine articles. Her status as a cultural figure
was a key reason she was appointed the
only female member of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation's first board of governors.
She maintained her political profile after
women's suffrage was achieved, serving as a
Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly
(MLA) in Alberta from 1921 to 1926. She was
also one of the "Famous Five" Alberta women
who in 1929 petitioned the Privy Council in
Great Britain in the "Persons Case" to have
women declared full legal "persons" in Canada.
A lifelong member of the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, she
represented Canada at the League of Nations
and was an outspoken opponent of the internment
of the Japanese and an advocate for Jewish
immigration to Canada during World War
II. Finally, she was a religious activist, lobbying
tirelessly for the ordination of women in
the United Church of Canada, a goal achieved
formally in 1934. While she is criticized by
some contemporary scholars for her "naive
liberalism" and Christian belief, her passionate
conviction that the Prairie West should become
a "Land of the Fair Deal," and her work
toward achieving it, embodied the optimism
and determination that mark Plains and Prairie
culture, in her day as today. McClung
moved to Victoria, British Columbia in 1935,
and died there on September 1, 1951.
