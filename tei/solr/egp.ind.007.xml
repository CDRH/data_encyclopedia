Banking


Citizens Bank, Wharton, Oklahoma Territory, 1894


Banking's role in the Great Plains economy
has long been important and controversial.
Most Great Plains states developed a commercial
banking system after enactment of the National
Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864. National
banks were required to hold relatively large
amounts of capital and could not make direct
loans to real estate. Nonresidents owned many
Great Plains national banks. State banks,
which had lower capital requirements and
made direct real estate loans, were more numerous
in the sparsely settled, agricultural
Great Plains and were usually locally owned;
successful merchants most commonly started
Great Plains banks.

Fearing that nonresidents would gain monopoly
control over allocation of bank credit,
many states adopted unit-banking policies
that prohibited banks from branching. As late
as 1980, only New Mexico and South Dakota
among Great Plains states allowed branching.
Numerous small banks with undiversified
loan portfolios dominated Great Plains banking

The unit-banking system proved to be fragile
during economic downturns. After the
Panic of 1907, several states experimented
with state-run deposit insurance systems as an
alternative to branch banking in providing
stability to the banking system. Between 1907
and 1917 eight states nationwide adopted deposit
insurance systems, including Kansas,
Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, and Texas. Chain banks and multibank
holding companies (group banking)
also developed as ways to evade restrictions on
branch banking.

During the 1920s and 1930s Great Plains
banking experienced substantial turmoil.
Prices of agricultural products rose during
World War I, with a resulting rapid expansion
in the number of banks. The postwar collapse
of agricultural prices and of land values resulted
in numerous bank failures when banks
saw the value of their loans dramatically fall.
During the 1920s state-run deposit insurance
systems may have intensified difficulties by
encouraging banks to take too many risks.
The banking system further contracted during
the early 1930s. In addition to failures of
thousands of unit banks, many chain banks
and bank holding companies did not survive
the Great Depression; however, some continued
to play a significant role in Great Plains
banking. For example, Minneapolis-based
First Bank and Norwest systems both owned
many banks in the Dakotas and in Montana.

The banks in the Prairie Provinces of Canada
fared much better during the 1920s and
1930s. A merger movement among Canadian
banks occurred after 1900. By 1920 Canada
had developed a nationwide branch-banking
system that was characterized by national diversification
and greater stability than in the
United States; no Canadian banks failed during
the Great Depression.

After World War II, commercial banks continued
to provide most non–real estate loans
to farmers. Banks gradually increased their
farm mortgages, which had substantially
dropped during the 1920s and 1930s; however,
federal land banks and life insurance companies
often provided a larger share of farm
mortgages. Banks faced increasing competition
from other depository institutions such as
savings and loan associations, which emphasized
home mortgage loans, and credit unions,
which emphasized consumer loans. Commercial
banks also became more actively involved
in lending to petroleum and natural gas businesses,
particularly in Colorado, Oklahoma,
Texas, and Wyoming.

Dramatic changes in Great Plains banking
occurred after 1980. Relatively high prices for
agricultural and energy products caused many
Great Plains banks to expand their lending to
these activities during the late 1970s. The recession
of the early 1980s combined with falling
prices for agricultural and energy products
to result in a bust in both sectors. The
undiversified loan portfolios of many Great
Plains banks resulted in numerous bank failures.
This time, many savings and loan associations
also failed. Between 1982 and 1994,
2,573 commercial banks and savings and loan
associations failed nationwide. Texas alone accounted
for more than 30 percent of these
failures, while Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska,
and Oklahoma combined accounted for more
than 14 percent.

Great Plains states responded differently to
these challenges. South Dakota changed its
usury law and actively sought national credit
card operations, particularly Citibank, to relocate
and thereby provide jobs. Others reluctantly
loosened restrictions on branch banking
and passed interstate banking legislation.
The 1994 Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and
Branching Efficiency Act effectively removed
remaining obstacles to interstate banking.

Since 1980 Great Plains banking has transformed
from being predominantly a unitbanking
industry to one that includes both
statewide branching and interstate banking.
Although the total number of banks has declined
by more than 30 percent, there has been
an increase in the number of bank branches.
While an increasing share of bank deposits is
under the control of large out-of-state organizations,
many smaller community banks continue
to flourish because they are able to provide
more personalized services, which many
customers still prefer, and they remain the
best source of information concerning the
credit-worthiness of local businesses.
