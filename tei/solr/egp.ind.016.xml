CONAGRA FOODS

ConAgra Foods, a diversified foods company
headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, is the second
largest food company in North America,
operating in 35 countries and employing
85,000 people. Its products span the food
chain: ConAgra Foods provides seeds, fertilizer,
and chemicals for crops; trades grains,
beans, and other agricultural commodities
internationally; mills flour, corn, and feed;
supplies ingredients to food and beverage
processors; and processes beef, pork, lamb,
chicken, turkey, seafood, and freshwater fish.
ConAgra is the largest supplier in North America
to food service operations such as restaurants,
cafeterias, and schools. It is also
the second largest grocery supplier of frozen,
refrigerated, and shelf-stable goods. ConAgra Foods' eighty products include Healthy
Choice, Banquet, Swiss Miss, Hunts Tomato,
Butterball, Bumble Bee, Wesson Oils, and
Country Pride.

ConAgra Foods was incorporated in 1919 as
Nebraska Consolidated Mills, the result of a
merger of four flour mills across central Nebraska:
Ravenna Mill, Hastings Mills, St. Edward
Mill, and Glade Milling in Grand Island,
where Nebraska Consolidated Foods made its
headquarters. A merger with Updike Mills of
Omaha in 1922 doubled the company's milling
capacity and resulted in moving the headquarters
to Omaha. An early success was the
development of Duncan Hines Cake Mix in
1951. Nebraska Consolidated Mills's first venture
beyond Nebraska was the construction of
a flour mill in Decatur, Alabama, in 1941. Its
first venture beyond the continental United
States was the construction of the Molinos
(Mills) de Puerto Rico, which opened in 1959.

In 1971 Nebraska Consolidated Mills was renamed
ConAgra, which in 2000 became ConAgra Foods. The company has grown rapidly
since 1976, largely through extensive acquisitions,
including Peavey, Armour, and Monfort,
and now ranks sixtieth overall in revenues
on the Fortune 500 list.
