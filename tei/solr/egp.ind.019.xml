FARM IMPLEMENTS


Implements store, Greeley, Colorado, ca. 1882


The production and use of farm implements
have always been important in the development
of the Great Plains. Current production
of farm implements remains an integral part
of the regional economy. Dominant sectors
include the production of forage and small
grain harvest equipment, seeding and tillage
equipment, irrigation equipment, large tractors,
chemical application equipment, and
equipment for specialized regional crops such
as sugar beets and potatoes. Although the
equipment produced reflects regional needs,
it is also sold in global markets.

Forage and small grains are important regional
crops in the semiarid climate of the
Great Plains. Significant manufacturers of
harvesters for these crops are located in the
Plains. Hay and Forage Industries, formerly
Hesston (Hesston, Kansas), produces a major
line of hay and forage harvesters. The small
round baler, conceived and developed by Nebraskan
Ummo Franklin Luebben, was initially
produced in Omaha. Manufacturing
rights were purchased, and the baler was
widely marketed by Allis-Chalmers during the
period 1940 to 1960.

New Holland (Grand Island, Nebraska) and
Gleaner-AGCO (Independence, Missouri) manufacture
combines for grain harvest. MacDon
(Winnipeg, Manitoba) makes combine headers.
Winds common on the Plains often cause
grain stalks to bend over and lodge before harvest.
Companies such as Crary (West Fargo,
North Dakota) supply attachments to pick up
and lift the crop. Massey-Harris developed the
self-propelled combine for use in the Great
Plains during the late 1930s. It became firmly
established during the 1940s, when there was a
labor shortage due to World War II, and organized
fleets of combines subsequently followed
the annual wheat harvest northward.

Seeding and tillage equipment manufacturers
have developed a wide variety of drills,
air seeders, and planters for both small and
coarse grains. Equipment was often originally
developed in response to regional climatic
needs but is now marketed extensively. Manufacturers
include Fleischer (Columbus, Nebraska),
Flexi-Coil (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan),
Great Plains (Salina, Kansas), Krause
(Hutchinson, Kansas), Tye-AGCO (Lockney,
Texas), and Wil-Rich (Wahpeton, North Dakota).
Some tillage equipment, such as the
disk plow and rod weeder (Morris Industries,
Yorkton, Saskatchewan), was developed to
conserve moisture and prevent wind erosion.
These implements are innovations of Plains
manufacturers. For example, Charles Noble
(Nobleford, Alberta) developed the Noble
blade cultivator during the 1930s in response
to Dust Bowl conditions.

Large open fields encouraged steam tractor
plowing of the grasslands. Four-wheel-drive
tractors with greater than 250 engine horsepower
are commonly used on larger farms
and ranches. They are produced by Case Corporation,
formerly Steiger (Fargo, North Dakota),
and New Holland, formerly Versatile
(Winnipeg, Manitoba). In response to disreputable
marketing of farm tractors early in this
century, the Nebraska legislature passed a law
in 1919 requiring that all tractors for sale in
that state be tested. Although the law was
amended in 1986 to permit standardized testing
from other facilities, the Nebraska tractor
test has been a standard by which most North
American tractors are judged.

Chemical application equipment is used
for weed control and fertilizer application.
Large fields have promoted the development of
self-propelled sprayers, such as those manufactured
by Melroe (Fargo, North Dakota).
Wind-swept Plains topography has influenced
the development of drift-control application
equipment, such as that produced by Rodgers
Engineering (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan).

Equipment for specialized crops grown in
parts of the Great Plains is important regionally
and is also marketed worldwide. Lockwood
Corporation (Gering, Nebraska) manufactures
potato production implements, and
Woods Equipment (Fargo, North Dakota)
markets equipment for sugar beet production.

In addition to larger manufacturers, hundreds
of smaller shops throughout the Great
Plains build, modify, supply parts for, and repair
farm implements. Their presence is evident
on the landscape of most Plains towns of
any size. Rather particular to this part of North
America, a harvest brigade of parts and repair
workers follows the annual wheat harvest by
custom combine operators from the Texas
Panhandle north to the international border.
