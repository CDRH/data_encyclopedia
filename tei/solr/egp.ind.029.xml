HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY

The oldest company in the Prairie Provinces
and one of the world's first joint-stock companies,
the Hudson's Bay Company has played
a major role in Plains history for three centuries,
first as a fur-trading company and then
as a large retailer, major landowner, and developer.

Charles II of England chartered the company
in 1670, granting it exclusive rights to
trade in the Hudson Bay drainage basin, a territory
that became known as Rupert's Land.
The company's monopoly, however, was never
safe. Its envoys first visited the Plains in the
late seventeenth century to invite Indians to
trade at York Factory on Hudson Bay and to
monitor competitors from New France. By
the 1690s the company had become a major
supplier of European goods to the Indigenous
peoples of the northern Great Plains. These
goods profoundly influenced lifestyles and
patterns of trade, warfare, and diplomacy
there.

From the 1690s to 1821 the company competed
on the Plains with Montreal-based
rivals. Like its competitors, it focused primarily
on the rich furs of the subarctic, but in
response to stiffening competition from Canadian
opponents after 1766 the company established
permanent posts on the northern
margins of the Plains after 1780. This began a
period of intense competition, with important
implications for the Native peoples of the
region. Although traders purchased furs (especially
wolf and fox but also some beaver)
from the Indians of the Plains, the region was
also important as the source of preserved
bison meat (especially pemmican) that the
Hudson's Bay Company and other companies
used to feed their employees in the subarctic.
Cree, Assiniboine, and Métis communities
supplied most of bison meat, although Blackfoot,
Sarcee, Gros Ventre, Mandan, Hidatsa,
and Ojibwa groups also traded directly with
the company. In 1812 the company established
the Red River Colony, the first permanent European
American settlement in the northern
Great Plains.

When the Hudson's Bay Company and the
North West Company merged in 1821, it seemed
that the Hudson's Bay Company would finally
enjoy its elusive monopoly, but with the border
between Rupert's Land and the United States
settled at the forty-ninth parallel in 1818, the
company faced growing challenges from Métis
free traders and American competitors. Before
1818 and even into the 1830s, the company acquired
furs trapped well south of the fortyninth
parallel. After 1830, the flow of furs
changed. Many Métis employees laid off by the
Hudson's Bay Company after the merger settled
in the Red River Colony, and the colony
became primarily Métis. Increasingly, Red
River Métis defied the company by trading furs
from Indians and selling them to businesses in
the northern United States. Also, the Columbia
Fur Company and American Fur Company
hired many of the talented traders (such as
Kenneth McKenzie) who were released from
the Hudson's Bay Company after 1821, and
these men helped the American Fur Company
establish trading relations with communities
such as the Blackfoot and Gros Ventres of the
Northern Plains. The Hudson's Bay Company
was also hampered by the fact that its supply
lines were expensive compared with its Missouri
River-based competition, especially
when the trade in bulky and heavy buffalo
robes became important after the 1830s. Thus,
between the 1830s and the 1870s, the competitive
position of the Hudson's Bay Company
weakened.

In 1870 the company reached an important
milestone when it sold Rupert's Land to Canada
for £300,000. As part of the agreement, the
company retained one-twentieth of the land in
the Prairie Provinces, much of which was destined
to become prime urban real estate. As a
result, the Hudson's Bay Company became a
major landowner and important real estate developer.
After 1870 the company's trade with
incoming settlers grew. Its wholesaling, retailing,
and real estate activities quickly dwarfed
its diminishing fur-trading operations, and it
developed a large chain of department stores
across Canada. In the twentieth century, it also
expanded its interests into natural resource development,
including oil and gas. In 1970 it
moved its headquarters from London to Winnipeg,
Manitoba. The company's papers, now
housed in Winnipeg, are one of the most valuable
sources for historians of the Prairie Provinces
and Northern Great Plains before 1870.
