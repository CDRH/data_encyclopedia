KARCHER, JOHN (1894-1978)

John Clarence Karcher, inventor of the reflection
seismograph, was born in Dale, Indiana,
on April 15, 1894, to Leo and Mary Madlon
Karcher and was raised on a farm near Hennessey,
Oklahoma. After graduating from
Hennessey High School in 1912, he attended
the University of Oklahoma, where he received
bachelor's degrees in physics and in
electrical engineering in 1916. From Oklahoma
he went to the University of Pennsylvania
to pursue graduate degrees, completing
his doctorate in 1918.

From 1917 onward John Karcher combined
his major area of study, physics, with geology,
due perhaps to his acquaintance with geologists
while at Oklahoma. During World War I,
he collaborated with the U.S. navy in trying to
develop a method of locating German artillery
batteries by tracking the sound and seismic
waves that their firing produced. In the process,
he was inspired to invent an instrument
that could map subsurface geologic structures
by measuring blast-induced vertical vibrations
in the earth. He subsequently designed,
built, and patented the reflection seismograph,
or at least an American version of that
tool, now an essential aspect of "prospecting"
for petroleum reservoirs.

In June 1921 Karcher, several University of
Oklahoma professors, and three Oklahoma
City oilmen successfully tested the reflection
seismograph north of Oklahoma City. In 1925
Karcher combined with Everette L. DeGolyer
of Amerada Petroleum Corporation to form
Geophysical Research Corporation. For the
next few years their crews prospected around
Seminole, Oklahoma, and finally identified a
structure likely to contain oil. There, in December
1928, Amerada successfully activated
the world's first oil well located by reflection
seismography.

Karcher's career took off in the late 1920s,
when he went into the petroleum production
business. His companies, among them Geophysical
Service Incorporated (which later
was sold and renamed Texas Instruments,
Incorporated), Coronado Corporation, Las
Tecas Petroleum Company, and Concho Petroleum
Company, prospected for oil, drilled
the wells, and marketed the product. Karcher
received the Anthony F. Lucas Gold Medal,
given by the American Institute of Mining,
Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers, for
developing the seismograph. John Clarence
Karcher died in Dallas, Texas, on July 13, 1978.
