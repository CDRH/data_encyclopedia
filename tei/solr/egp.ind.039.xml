MELROE BOBCAT

The Melroe Bobcat, now sold in seventy-five
countries through 900 dealerships and celebrated
by Fortune magazine as one of the 100
best products in the United States, has its
origins in Great Plains local enterprise. In 1947
E. G. Melroe, the son of Norwegian immigrants,
founded the Melroe Manufacturing
Company in the small North Dakota community
of Gwinner. Through the 1950s the company
thrived on the sales of Melroe's first invention,
a windrow pickup device attached to
combines that could collect windrows of grain
with little loss of kernels. In 1957 Melroe's sons
(E. G. Melroe had died in 1955) bought the
rights to a homemade three-wheeled loader
that had been built by Cyril and Louis Keller
of Rothsay, Minnesota. The Kellers became
employees of Melroe Manufacturing Company,
and the first in a developing line of Melroe
Bobcats came off the assembly line.

The Bobcat was initially a three-wheeled
light loader that could turn 360 degrees in its
own length. By 1963 an additional wheel had
added more stability, and the utility of the
Bobcat had been proven in industry and construction
as well as in agriculture. Refinements
in design (for example, a quick-change
attachment system was developed in 1973 to
make the Bobcat a multijob machine) and diversification
of models for different jobs (for
example, the Mini-Bob loader was produced
in 1971 for work in the most restrictive spaces)
have kept the Melroe Bobcat at the forefront
of the loader and excavation business.

The Melroe Company, now headquartered
in Fargo and with plants in Gwinner and Bismarck,
is North Dakota's largest manufacturer,
and the Bobcat logo, featuring the head
of that tough, agile Plains animal, can be seen
on building sites, farms, and industrial operations
worldwide.
