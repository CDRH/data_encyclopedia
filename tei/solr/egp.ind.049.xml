PIZZA HUT

The international restaurant chain Pizza Hut,
Inc., was founded in Wichita, Kansas, by
brothers Dan and Frank Carney, students at
Wichita State University. With $600 borrowed
from their mother, the young men opened a
small pizzeria at a busy Wichita intersection
on June 15, 1958. They mixed dough in a plastic
baby bathtub and gave away pizza slices to
attract customers. A family member remarked
that their little building looked like a hut, and
the name Pizza Hut was born. (This structure
has been moved and is preserved on the university
campus.)

After just over a year, the Carneys owned
five Wichita Pizza Huts. In 1959 they incorporated
and opened a franchise in Topeka. Their
small chain soon expanded across Kansas and
into Oklahoma, Texas, and other states. With
the opening of their first Pizza Hut in Canada,
they entered the international market in 1968.

By 1971 Pizza Hut had added franchises in
Australia and Europe, making it the world's
number one pizza restaurant chain in both
sales and number of outlets. The next year its
stock began trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. In 1977 stockholders approved a
merger with PepsiCo, Inc., for a reported $300
million.

Both founders left the company (Dan Carney
in 1974, Frank in 1980), but PepsiCo retained
Pizza Hut's corporate offices in Wichita
until 1995, when operations were shifted to
Dallas, Texas. Two years later, PepsiCo spun
off Pizza Hut and its two other restaurant
holdings. As a division of Tricon Global Restaurants,
Inc., of Louisville, Kentucky, Pizza
Hut, Inc., entered the twenty-first century
with more than 10,000 restaurants, 3,000 of
them in eighty-six foreign countries.
