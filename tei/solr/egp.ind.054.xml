SPRINT

Sprint, the global communications company
based in Westwood, Kansas, has its rather
humble origins in Abilene, Kansas. There, in
1902, Jacob and C. L. Brown chartered the
Brown Telephone Company, seeking to target
the rural market that tended to be overlooked
by the Bell Telephone Company, which dominated
the industry. In 1911 the Brown Telephone
Company incorporated with three
other Kansas independents as the United Telephone
Company, making it the second largest
such company in the state. The groundwork
had been laid for a century of virtually uninterrupted
expansion.

By 1925, United Telephone and Electric, or UT&amp;E, as it was then called, controlled 68
companies, mainly telephone companies. UT&amp;E rode out the Depression, when
millions of impoverished subscribers gave up
their phones, and by the 1950s the againrenamed
United Utilities was the nation's third
largest independent phone company.

United Utilities grew rapidly during the
1960s and 1970s, diversifying its concerns (into
telecommunications equipment manufacturing,
for example) and modernizing its operations
(to dial operation in the 1960s, then into
digital systems in the late 1970s). The company'snew name, United Telecom (adopted in
1972), captured its new high-technology image
and priorities. In 1986, following the breakup
of "Ma Bell," United Telecom and gte Sprint,
the low-cost long-distance telephone company,
entered into an equal partnership and
immediately took advantage of the nation's
new fiber-optic network. In 1991 United Telecom
fully acquired Sprint and took the name
Sprint Corporation. During the 1990s, Sprint
extended its operations globally, entering into
agreements with French, German, Canadian,
and Mexican communications companies.
Sprint has also consolidated its domestic market
and now has services in forty-eight states.
In all, Sprint, the end product (so far) of the
Browns' small Abilene telephone company,
serves more than 17 million customers and returns
about $17 billion in annual revenues.
