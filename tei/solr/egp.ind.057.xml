TELUS

Telus Corporation is an Alberta–British Columbia
telecommunication firm created by
the 1999 merger of two province-based companies.
It is the second largest telecommunication
organization in Canada and one of the
largest business operations in Canada headquartered
in the West.

Telus's emergence reflects the changing
goals of western provincial enterprises and
governments and the influence of federal regulations.
Until privatized and renamed Telus
in 1990, the former Alberta Government Telephones
operated from 1908 to 1990 as a provincial
crown enterprise regulated and sheltered
under a provincial public utilities board.
Operating from 1904 to 1999, bc Telephone,
renamed bc Telecom in 1992 and a wholly
owned subsidiary since 1926 of American utility
gte, was confined to provincial activity
under the federal regulation that oversaw
private-sector utilities.

In 1988 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled
that federal regulation of telecommunication
included provincial crown-owned enterprises,
and in 1992 the federal regulator, the Canadian
Radio-Television and Telecommunication
Commission, began allowing interprovincial
telecommunication competition. The
merger between Edmonton-based Telus and
Vancouver-based BC Telecom has enabled
Telus to compete nationally with other telecommunication
and cable providers for the
total market of data, Internet, voice, and wireless
communication. Current federal regulation
of telecommunication stipulates that
rates and ownership structures are controlled
but not competition for markets. Telus shares
are one-fifth held by Verizon, the successor to
gte and Bell Atlantic. Telus has made major
acquisitions in Canada and abroad in order to
compete throughout Canada, in the United
States, and elsewhere.
