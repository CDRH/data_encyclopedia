INDIAN CLAIMS COMMISSION

In 1946, after decades of periodic debate, the
United States established the Indian Claims
Commission to give Native Americans their
"day in court." The commission operated until
1978. Native American tribes and bands
were given five years to register claims with the
commission, claims relating to past injustices
of federal Indian policy, including lands illegally
taken, lands taken for "unconscionably
low" compensation, and the government's
misuse of Indian monies. Most Native American
groups did register claims, and many
claims were upheld, but ultimately there was
little justice delivered in the process.

The Indian Claims Commission, comprised
of three (later four) judges appointed by the
president, actually functioned as a court that
heard arguments of two adversaries–the Native
American claimants and the United States
as defendant–and then passed judgment.
Awards were monetary only; return of land
was expressly excluded. In a typical claim involving
land, the Native American claimants
had first to prove title to that land, then show
that the original compensation paid (generally
during the nineteenth century) was significantly
below its fair market value at the time of
taking. The difference between the fair market
value and the original compensation (minus
lawyers' fees and other offsets) constituted the
award. Once an award was accepted or a case
dismissed, then that claim was dead forever.
Despite platitudes about "belated justice," the
United States primarily intended this to be a
wiping clean of the slate of outstanding claims
as a prelude to termination–the prevailing
policy to eliminate tribes as a separate factor in
American society.

Altogether, by the deadline, 176 tribes and
bands lodged 370 claims, which were separated
into 617 dockets. Plains tribes were well represented.
From the Lipan Apaches of southern
Texas to the Blackfeet and Gros Ventres of
northern Montana and from the Omahas of
eastern Nebraska to the Crows of Wyoming,
Plains Indians took their grievances to the
commission.

In all, eighteen Plains tribes and nations
lodged claims. The largest award, $35,060,000
for land primarily in West Texas, went to the
Kiowas, Comanches, and Apaches in 1974.
Other sizable awards included $15 million
(1965) to the Cheyennes and Arapahos for
lands in northeastern Colorado and adjacent
Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas; and
$10,242,984 to the Crows (1954) for their traditional
homelands in Wyoming and Montana.
The smallest award–$2,458–was made to the
Poncas of Nebraska in 1965 for an accounting
claim. In the most notorious case, involving
the Lakotas' (Sioux) 1877 cession of the Black
Hills, the Indian Claims Commission's award
of $17.5 million (without interest) was appealed
and eventually reached the Supreme
Court, which ruled in 1980 that, because the
taking was unconstitutional, not just inadequate,
the Lakotas merited interest on the
award from 1877 on. Their award, accumulating
to more than $600 million by the late 1990s,
sits unclaimed in the U.S. Treasury; the Lakotas
want their sacred Black Hills back, not a monetary
settlement.

On close analysis, even sizable awards diminished
to small payments when they were
allocated to individual Native Americans.
(Sometimes awards were put into tribal investments,
but this was often contentious, because
the tribal members who did not reside on reservations
would not benefit from reservation
development.) The Pawnees of central Nebraska,
for example, were awarded $7,316,096
in 1964, largely for lands that had been taken
in the nineteenth century for unconscionably
low compensation. Of this, the lawyers
took $876,897 for fees and expenses, leaving
$6,439,199. In March 1964 the tribal council
voted to distribute the award (with a small
amount of accrued interest) on a per capita
basis to the 1,883 enrolled members of the
tribe. Each Pawnee received about $3,530–no
doubt a boon in (always) hard times, but
hardly a redress of past injustices. The Omahas,
the Pawnees' traditional neighbors, received
even less ($750 for each tribal member)
in their 1960 settlement, and each Yankton
Sioux accepted $249 in 1960 as a reward for
enduring ten years of litigation in their land
claims case.

The Indian Claims Commission, therefore,
should be viewed more as a continuation of
the past than a break from it. As in the nineteenth
century, most Plains Indians (and Native
Americans elsewhere in the country) felt
obliged to accept the United States' definition
of what constituted justice. At no stage of the
litigation process before the Indian Claims
Commission was the value that Plains Indians
placed on their lands as homelands taken into
account.
