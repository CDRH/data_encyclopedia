INDIAN POLICE


Mounted Dakota Sioux Indian police, Rosebud Agency, South Dakota, 1896


Indian police forces first appeared on the
Great Plains during the 1830s, when the federal
government relocated eastern tribes such
as the Cherokees to Indian Territory. Known
as the Lighthorse, Cherokee police units performed
law enforcement duties similar to
their European American counterparts of the
period. During the 1860s and 1870s Indian
agents throughout the American West began
to organize police forces to protect reservations
from cattle and horse rustlers, timber
thieves, and liquor peddlers. In 1862, for example,
the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
agent at the Pawnee Agency in Nebraska created
a police force to curb horse thefts. Agents
at Red Cloud and Spotted Tail Agencies in
northwestern Nebraska created similar forces
during the 1870s. These police forces operated
autonomously, without federal approval or
funding. This changed in 1878, when Congress
legitimized Indian police forces by providing
funds and operational guidelines. BIA agents
quickly organized Native police forces, in part
because this increased their influence over reservation
affairs and removed the need for military
troops. By the end of 1878 police forces
operated at twenty-two agencies. Three years
later forty-nine of sixty-eight agencies had police
forces, and by 1890 the number had risen
to fifty-nine.

Indian policemen are often viewed unfavorably
by historians. Using examples such as
the 1890 killing of Sitting Bull by Standing
Rock policemen or the role of BIA police officers
at Wounded Knee in 1973, many scholars
have portrayed Indian policemen as traitors to
their own people. This interpretation fails to
acknowledge the origins of police forces. The
concept of tribal police forces was not new to
Plains Indians. All tribes traditionally had law
enforcers. Traditional Lakota law enforcers,
known as akicitas, enforced tribal laws and
customs, policed camp moves, and regulated
buffalo hunts. When the first agency police
force was organized at Pine Ridge (presentday
South Dakota) in 1879, it was the akicitas
who filled its ranks, suggesting that the Lakotas
may have used this institution to continue
their traditional roles.

Indian policemen performed an array of
duties. Day-to-day tasks included maintaining
law and order in and around the agency,
including guarding agency property and storehouses,
arresting drunks and gamblers, maintaining
the agency jail, and serving as messengers
and scouts. Armed and mounted
policemen also patrolled reservation boundaries,
driving off or arresting stock thieves, liquor
peddlers, and timber thieves. More controversial
duties sometimes included forcing
children to attend agency schools and enforcing
bans on polygamy, dancing, and traditional
ceremonies. In carrying out their duties
Indian policemen were often put in danger.
Between 1876 and 1906 at least twenty-four Indian
police officers were killed in Indian Territory
alone. In the deadliest day for Indian
policemen, six members of Standing Rock's
Indian police force were killed on December
15, 1890, while attempting to arrest Sitting Bull.

Early Indian police forces were usually
poorly equipped. With little federal support,
agents were left on their own to arm and clothe
their police officers. Agents at Rosebud and Pine
Ridge Agencies, for example, armed their forces
with borrowed weapons from nearby Fort
Robinson. By the mid-1880s, however, the Department
of the Interior was providing standardized
uniforms, badges, and weaponry. Dismally
low remuneration was another problem.
Ranking officers in 1880 earned only $8 a
month, while enlisted men received a paltry $5
for a month's labor. Even as late as 1927 many
Lakota policemen had to supplement their income
by farming. Most forces experienced high
turnover rates, because policemen could earn
more money as military scouts or laborers.

Each Indian police force looked and operated
differently from the others. On Lakota
reservations police units operated almost like
the military. Pine Ridge's police force regularly
drilled under the command of ex-military officers
and patrolled reservation boundaries in
small mounted squads. Cherokee and Choctaw
police officers, however, operated more
like a European American constabulary, performing
law enforcement tasks as sheriffs and
deputies. Police forces also varied in size.
Units at Pine Ridge and Rosebud Agencies included
the maximum of fifty policemen, while
the smaller Cheyenne River Agency had only
nine officers on its original force.

The early 1880s were the heyday for Indian
police forces on the Great Plains. During these
years Indian police forces performed all law
enforcement duties on their reservations and
operated largely free of federal control. By the
mid-1880s, however, federal laws began to encroach
on the autonomy of the criminal justice
system on reservations. The Major Crimes
Act of 1885 gave the federal government jurisdiction
in most felonies, limiting the duties
of Indian police officers. The Dawes Act further
curtailed the authority of Indian police
by placing allottees under the jurisdiction of
the state in which they resided. By 1900 the
large Indian police forces of the 1880s had disappeared.
Without federal financial support,
most reservations could employ only one or
two police officers by the 1920s; even the largest
Lakota reservation employed only seventeen
officers. By the 1950s Bureau of Indian
Affairs police forces had supplanted most
agency forces. In 2000 Bureau of Indian Affairs
police forces operated in every Great
Plains state except Texas.
