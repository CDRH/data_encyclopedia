LEAVENWORTH PENITENTIARY

Leavenworth Penitentiary in eastern Kansas
was the first of three federal prisons authorized
during the 1890s to avoid housing federal
prisoners in state prisons known for scandal
and mistreatment of inmates. Prisoners
have been incarcerated in the Leavenworth
area since before Kansas gained statehood in
1861. At that time, a territorial jail there became
the first state penitentiary. Congress established
the U.S. Army Disciplinary Barracks
at Fort Leavenworth in 1874. In 1895 Congress
ordered the military prison transferred to the
Department of Justice, creating one of the first
federal prisons for civilian offenders. (The
U.S. government operated a penitentiary in
Washington DC from 1831 to 1862 as well as
territorial prisons.)

During the next eleven years, inmates
marched from the fort to a nearby construction
site on the military reservation where
they built the Leavenworth Penitentiary according
to plans drawn by the St. Louis architecture
firm Eames and Young. The lack of
skilled labor and the painstaking security
measures necessitated by using convict laborers
made for slow progress. Inmates began
occupying the new facility in 1903, but the
population did not transfer entirely from the
military prison until 1906. Construction continued,
with cell blocks completed by 1919,
shoe shops by 1926, a brush and broom factory
by 1928, and the offices and rotunda
by 1929. The penitentiary became a tourist
attraction even as it was being built. The arrival
of 200 tourists from Kansas City in a
single day in 1910 led the warden to suspend
tours temporarily. Planners expected 1,200
cells would accommodate 1,200 prisoners, but
crowding led officials to abandon that ideal.
As early as 1915 the prison population reached
1,800. By 1925 the population had climbed to
3,262. Continued crowding led to another annexation
of the Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary
Barracks from 1929 through 1940. At the
beginning of the twenty-first century, the penitentiary
housed 1,726 inmates.
