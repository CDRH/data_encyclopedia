NORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE

Created by an act of the Canadian Parliament
in 1873 as "a Police Force in the North West
Territories," the North-West Mounted Police
(as it was officially known from 1879 through
1904) was the first version of today's Royal
Canadian Mounted Police. The force made its
mythic reputation by its actions while policing
the Canadian Great Plains from 1874 on as it
prepared the West for both the Canadian Pacific
Railway (completed in 1885) and the settlers
who followed.

The "Great Lone Land" that became the
Canadian Prairie Provinces had been held
since the late seventeenth century as Rupert's
Land by the Hudson's Bay Company. European
American fur traders, both passing
through and living on the land, worked with
Native peoples (mainly Crees) in the trade and
together created the Métis as a separate people.
Not until 1869, with the transfer of Rupert's
Land to the new Dominion government
of Canada, was there conflict; the Métis, led by
Louis Riel in the Red River Resistance, protested
the transfer and instigated a second rebellion
in 1885. Prime Minister Sir John A.
Macdonald, having expanded his new nation
to the Pacific Coast with the promise to British
Columbia of an all-Canadian transcontinental
railway and very aware of settlement pressures
and conflicts between the U.S. Army and Native
Americans just south of the "Medicine
Line," realized that he needed some agency to
govern Canada's vast new territory, prepare
for the railway, and defend Canada's sovereignty
against American incursion. Upon
receiving news of a massacre of Assiniboines
in the Cypress Hills during the summer of
1873, Macdonald acted by creating the North-
West Mounted Police (NWMP).

Consciously modeled on police forces found
elsewhere in the empire, the nwmp was intended
to appear British; its constables' characteristic
red tunics were chosen to contrast–
especially in the minds of Native people–with
the blue of the U.S. Army. At the same time,
Macdonald carefully styled them as police
rather than military so as to keep from alarming
the Americans. The 300 new recruits were
given a challenging task: police an area of some
300,000 square miles. After organizing in
Manitoba over the winter of 1873-74, they set
out west in July 1874 on what has come to be
known as the "Great March," which, given its
numerous difficulties, has usually been seen as
epic. Divisions separated in order to set up
posts throughout the region, most proximate
to the U.S.-Canadian border and with a particular
concentration in what is now southern
Alberta, the area frequented by American
whiskey traders from Fort Benton, Montana.

Once the NWMP was established, the whiskey
traders were routed, and peaceful relations
with the Natives had been effected, the force set
about preparing the way for settlement. Constables
were dispatched to smaller and more
remote posts and, through a method of regular
patrols and central reporting, both got to
know their areas and kept their commanders
aware of local conditions. Because of personnel
limitations coupled with the status each
constable had as a de facto justice of the peace
(that is, constables who arrested also judged),
the nwmp style of policing was in marked contrast
to that found south of the border, especially
in its initial dealings with Native peoples.
"Maintain the Right" is the force's motto, and
such was its accomplishment during its first
decade.

From its beginning, the nwmp was a cloistered
entity whose ongoing existence was not
certain, and its first commissioners were concerned
with public perception of the force. A
newspaper illustrator from the Canadian Illustrated News accompanied the Great March
west, and from that time on, journalists served
to create and enlarge the myth of the Mounted
Police. No single instance made this more evident
than Sitting Bull's time in Canada after
the Battle of the Little Bighorn in June 1876.
Many Native Americans moved north of the
border to escape avenging U.S. soldiers. Sitting
Bull arrived in 1877. The Lakota leader trusted
the Mounted Police, especially Superintendent
James Walsh, whom newspapers dubbed "Sitting
Bull's Boss." The negotiations between
governments–Canada, Great Britain, and the
United States–over the "American" Lakotas
drew enormous media attention. These episodes,
during which the force's actions toward
the Native peoples were comparatively and
retrospectively positive, are the basis of the
Mounted Police's mythic reputation.

By treating people, irrespective of race,
fairly, the nwmp reasonably claims a corporate
reputation based on the numerous instances
of casual and commonplace heroism
characterizing its early history generally and
its dealings with Native peoples particularly.
Such acts in turn suggest a group diligence
embodied in the ubiquitous "get their man"
cliche. The phrase, coined by an American
newspaper and perpetuated by popular writers
and Hollywood's twentieth-century infatuation
with the North-West Mounted Police,
is still used to characterize the force in its present
but very different form as a 200,000-
strong national force with liaisons in twentyseven
foreign capitals.
