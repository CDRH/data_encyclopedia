CHILDREN'S LITERATURE

The most realistic children's literature about
the Plains during the settlement period and
into the 1920s can be found in family periodicals.
Popular magazines such as St. Nicholas
and weekly newspapers like the Youth's Companion
highlighted the sense of adventure to
be discovered on the Plains frontier as well as
the uniqueness of the various Native American
cultures.

Although these periodicals published works
by well-known writers of the era, a large percentage
of the stories were by lesser-known
writers such as Kate M. Cleary, Elia Peattie, and
William R. Lighton, who wrote fiction about
Nebraska; Charles Askins, John R. Spears, Elizabeth
Grinnell, and G. W. Ogden, who set their
stories in Kansas and Oklahoma; L. Frank
Baum and Franklin Welles Calkins, whose stories
depict Wyoming and the Dakotas; and Canadian
writers Nellie McClung and Edward
McTavish, whose tales center on Manitoba,
and Rev. Charles W. Gordon (aka Ralph Connor),
whose best-selling fiction represents life
in Saskatchewan. Many authors contributed
only one story, usually based on personal accounts
of Plains life. Serials were especially
popular, like The Little Squatters by Hamlin
Garland, The Boy Settlers by Noah Brooks, and
A Banker's Judgment by Marianne Gauss.

The typical pattern in the stories of Plains
settlement is of an initiation, beginning with a
physical and emotional separation as the children
withdraw into an unknown and often
hostile environment. The innocent pioneer
versus the complex frontier forms the conflict.
Although the stories about boys reaching
manhood have various plots and settings, the
boys' tasks are mainly physical tests. Stereotypically,
the girls achieve a moral rather than
physical triumph.

Though strongly informed by this earlier
tradition, children's literature of the Plains
published since the 1930s has all but eclipsed
these periodical writers. In 1932 Laura Ingalls
Wilder, with the help of her daughter, Rose
Wilder Lane, published Little House in the Big Woods, commencing a family saga now
known collectively as the Little House books.
The genius of Wilder's vision is its blending of
adventure and domestic realism, its positing
of a feisty, tomboy heroine, Laura, against the
ameliorating influence of her gentle sister,
Mary, and her firm-handed mother, Caroline.
Along the way, readers receive moral lessons,
learn songs, poems, and recipes, and gain an
understanding of schooling, farming, and
town building on the Plains during the late
nineteenth century. Wilder's series provided
a narrative pattern for many other children's
writers of the Plains, including Carol Ryrie
Brink (Caddie Woodlawn and Magical Melons),
Lois Lenski (Prairie School), Barbara Smucker
(Days of Terror), Patricia MacLachlan (Sarah Plain and Tall), Pam Conrad (Prairie Songs,
Prairie Visions, and My Daniel), Laurie Lawlor
(the Addie series), Celia Barker Lottridge
(Ticket to Curlew), Kathryn Lasky (The Bone Wars), Cecil Freeman Beeler (The Girl in the Well), and Charlene Joy Talbot (An Orphan for Nebraska). Adventure writers like Texan Fred
Gipson (Old Yeller) continue the tradition of
the male initiation story, yet even Gipson's classic
novel centers its dramatic plot around the
stability of home and a strong mother figure.

Though the history of settlement preoccupies
children's writers of the Plains, a number
of other significant genres emerged in the
twentieth century. In particular, this literature
has attempted to provide a more accurate and
humane depiction of Plains tribes than found
in many settlement novels. Native and non-
Native writers alike have worked to replace
stereotypes and misrepresentations of Native
American life with truthful, unedited retellings
of oral tales and balanced portraits of life
in biographies and fiction. Mari Sandoz (The Horsecatcher, The Story Catcher), Virginia
Driving Hawk Sneve (Betrayed, When Thunders Speak), Maria Campbell (People of the Buffalo), and Paul Goble (The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses) have added immeasurably to
children's appreciation of Native American/
First Nations history, oral storytelling, and art.

Some Plains children's writers focus on
contemporary life with all its attendant problems
and challenges. In 1967 Oklahoma writer
S. E. Hinton changed the course of contemporary
young adult literature with her gritty first
novel, The Outsiders. Ivy Ruckman's bestselling
Night of the Twisters re-creates modern
Grand Island, Nebraska, during the hours of a
natural disaster. To this day, literary realism
defines children's literature of the Plains. Even
the Oz stories of the great fantasist L. Frank
Baum bear the imprint of realism. However,
Native American writers for children are now
adding the fabric of vision, myth, and legend
to this tradition of realism, countering European
American myths of settlement and creating
new narrative patterns inspired by oral
storytelling.
