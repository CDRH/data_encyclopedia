LAROCQUE, EMMA (b. 1949)

Emma LaRocque (University of Manitoba)


Emma LaRocque is a Plains Cree Métis who
was born in a log cabin on January 2, 1949, in
Big Boy, northeastern Alberta. Her family
made a living from trapping. In Defeathering the Indian (1975), she points out that she did
not know that she was poor or culturally deprived
until she started school. Her book de
scribes a happy childhood, and though she
insisted on being sent to school at an early age,
in retrospect she is saddened by the fact that
this education stole her away from her parents
and her culture. LaRocque worked as a teacher
on the Janvier Reservation until 1971, then as a
reporter and editor for the Alberta Native
Communications Society's newspaper, Native People. She has earned two master's degrees
and is now a professor of Native studies at the
University of Manitoba.

LaRocque is both a literary critic and a
poet. Her early writing began with cogent discussions
of colonization and oppression and
how these have affected Métis society. She has
since become a powerful political writer in
the broader fields of social criticism, human
rights issues, women's rights, and family violence.
She feels that much of her writing has
been constrained by her academic training
and deplores the fact that if she draws on information
from experts within her culture, it
is not accepted by the academy. She also resists
what she calls the "ghettoization" of Native
literature, whereby it is defined as "Native"
when indeed it may address universal issues.
LaRocque's poetry does indeed address universal
issues, as in "Coffins Fell from the Sky,"
a lament upon the news that her mother had
terminal cancer, but the "angry prairie wind
of coldstone Canada" (from the poem "1990")
also blows through her poems, lodging them
in her Métis Alberta background.
