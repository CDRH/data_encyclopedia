MITCHELL, W. O. (1914-1998)

William Ormond Mitchell was the most loved
of Canadian authors, his fiction and drama
spanning the worlds of popular entertainment
and literary art. Born on March 13, 1914, in
Weyburn, Saskatchewan, to Ormond and
Margaret McMurray Mitchell, he grew up on
the Prairies and attended the Universities of
Manitoba and Alberta. His first and most celebrated
novel, Who Has Seen the Wind (1947),
launched a distinguished literary career, during
which he wrote drama for radio, screen,
stage, and television as well as short stories
and nine more novels, including the critically
acclaimed The Vanishing Point (1973) and How I Spent My Summer Holidays (1981). Mitchell
also became a mentor to younger authors as
writer in residence at several universities and
was awarded the Order of Canada and other
honors before his death in Calgary on February
25, 1998.

Mitchell's broadest popularity grew from
his Jake and the Kid radio series, a humorous
look at Prairie life that ran for more than 300
episodes, and from his public performances in
the tradition of Charles Dickens, Mark Twain,
and Stephen Leacock. As a humorist, Mitchell
claimed literary descent particularly from
Twain. Mitchell's greatest critical success is
Who Has Seen the Wind, the story of a Prairie
boy's search for meaning that has become a
Canadian classic.

Mitchell was, in one respect, a victim of his
own success. His lyric evocation of a child's
world of innocence is so compelling that
readers can be distracted from his enduring
themes of the fall from innocence and the
problems of human mortality. On the other
hand, Mitchell's popularity enabled him to
create for all Canadians an ancestral home on
the Prairies.
