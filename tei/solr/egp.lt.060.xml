PORTER, KATHERINE ANNE (1890-1980)

Portrait photograph of Katharine Anne Porter

    
Katherine Anne Porter's varied fictional treatments
of the Great Plains areas of Texas and
the Southwest are important documents in
the historical and cultural study of these regions.
It must be kept in mind, however, that
Porter–like most writers of fiction—freely
adapted descriptions of this area for her own
aesthetic purposes; hence, absolute realism
cannot be expected in her fictional accounts
of the Texas Hill Country, where she was born
–at Indian Creek on May 15, 1890–and grew
to maturity and which provided an important
impetus for her creative work.

Among the finely crafted works of short fiction
that describe and analyze the Great Plains
areas of Texas and the Southwest are He (1927), The Jilting of Granny Weatherall (1929), The Grave (1935), Noon Wine (1937), Old Mortality (1938), and Holiday (1960). Inseparable from the hardscrabble rural landscapes are the memorable characters who are extensions and personifications of the land itself. The domineering
grandmother in numerous stories has,
in fact, been described as a "metaphor for
Texas" because of her determination to survive
and prosper despite the hardships and calamities
inherent in the prevailing conditions.

Katherine Anne Porter, after a life of accomplishment
(including a National Book
Award and Pulitzer Prize, both in 1966) and
enthusiastic living (she married and divorced
three times), died on September 18, 1980, in
Silver Spring, Maryland.
