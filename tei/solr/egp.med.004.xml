BILLINGS GAZETTE

The Billings (Montana) Gazette can truly
claim to have risen from the ashes—the ashes
of a fire that consumed its printing plant the
night before its maiden edition on May 3, 1885.
Displaying frontier grit and resourcefulness,
the newspaper's first editor, J. D. Matheson,
rescued enough type from the ruins to compose
a single sheet, nine by twelve inches,
printed on both sides. By the following week
the fledgling journal was up to four pages.

The Gazette itself was created from a melding
of three earlier newspapers, the Herald,
the Rustler, and the Post. The latter had been
started three years earlier, in 1882, in the
neighboring town of Coulson by Abel Kelsey
Yerkes, the "Poet of Sourdough Creek." When
Yerkes moved his publication to Billings in
July 1882, only a handful of buildings dotted
the alkali flats by the Yellowstone River, and
there were only 500 residents in the town
(named after Frederick Billings, former president
of the Northern Pacific Railroad). By the
following January there were 1,200. The overnight
boom led to the enduring nickname the
"Magic City."

The Gazette rode the growth curve, purchasing
the town's first linotype machine in
1901. It editorialized for a better water supply
and stronger fire protection. It chronicled the
raw energy of the emerging agricultural and
railroad center and its denizens, among them
Calamity Jane and Liver-Eating Johnson.

After consolidation with the Billings Evening Journal in 1908, the newspaper was published
under both names until 1916, when the
Journal name was dropped. Both morning
and evening editions were published. The
same year the Anaconda Copper Mining Company
purchased a controlling interest, as it did
with papers in Anaconda, Butte, Helena, Livingston,
and Missoula, thereby launching
nearly a half century of company-controlled
journalism in Montana. The paternalistic ACM
treated its employees well and chose to ignore
its foes, clamping a lid on news critical of the
company or inimical to its interests.

The newspaper grew, expanding its distribution
boundaries, first along railroad lines,
then more broadly across eastern Montana
and northern Wyoming as road networks built
up. By 1927 the Gazette was the city's largest
year-round industry, employing 112 persons
and with an annual payroll of $200,000. In 1934
it reported the highest circulation of any daily
newspaper in the state, a distinction it still
holds. By 1941 there were 20,374 subscribers,
and the paper was rolling out as many as five
different morning editions.

Finally realizing the incongruity of a mining
and processing company owning a string
of newspapers, acm sold them all to Lee
Newspapers of Davenport, Iowa, on June 1,
1959. Lee president Don Anderson promoted
the Gazette's Duane "Doc" Bowler to managing
editor in 1960 with orders to "make a
newspaper of it." Under Lee ownership, which
continues to this day, the Gazette grew even
faster. The newspaper moved out of its old
offices (jocularly referred to by local newspapermen
as the "Fourth House," in reference
to three houses of prostitution that had once
shared the same corner) to its present headquarters
in 1968.

Today, the Gazette's circulation is about
60,000, covering one of the largest regional
newspaper distribution areas in the United
States, and the newspaper has an editorial staff
of eighty. The "phoenix of the Plains," 115
years old at the turn of the twenty-first century,
has proven its staying power.
