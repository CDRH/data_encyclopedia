BRINKLEY, JOHN RICHARD (1885-1942)

John R. Brinkley pioneered radio broadcasting
with numerous innovations that influenced
the industry for decades. Brinkley was
born in Beta, North Carolina, on July 8, 1885.
His father was a mountain doctor who apprenticed
to learn medicine, much like lawyers
learned their craft in the nineteenth century.
The son decided on a career in medicine,
receiving a degree from the Eclectic Medical
University of Kansas City, an institution of
questionable standards and ethics. He began
practicing in 1918 in the small Kansas town of
Milford and pioneered in glandular surgery,
developing a lucrative operation that brought
him worldwide attention for rejuvenating elderly
men with goat glands. He advertised his
unique operation over the new medium of
radio.

Brinkley presciently envisioned the potential
of radio and received a license from the
Federal Radio Commission to operate station
KFKB in 1923, becoming one of the first commercial
broadcasters in the nation. He pioneered
radio programming with a twelve-hour
daily combination of country music, news,
markets, orchestras, local talent, medical advice,
and travelogues describing his world
journeys, all directed toward a rural audience.
He also experimented with bringing college
extension courses into the home, utilizing professors
from nearby Kansas State College, and
allowing politicians free airtime and a citizens
forum during which the civic questions of listeners
could be answered. His station, broadcasting
at 5,000 watts, became popular over a
wide area and in 1929 was voted best in the
nation in a poll conducted by Radio Digest.
That same year he conceived the idea for a
show called Medical Question Box, during
which his rustic listeners described their ailments.
He read their symptoms over the air,
then prescribed remedies available at his pharmacy.
After regional pharmacists became upset
over this intrusion, Brinkley changed to
recommending the prescriptions be filled at
his listeners' local drugstore, and pharmacists
gave him a cut on each sale.

This competition aroused the ire of the
Kansas City Star, which owned radio station
wdaf, both because of lost revenues from prescription
drug advertisements and loss of the
popularity contest to Brinkley's station. The
American Medical Association was also disturbed
over his lack of ethics in advertising,
and the two combined to have both his medical
and radio licenses revoked in 1930. Brinkley
unsuccessfully ran for governor that year, hoping
to name a new medical board for Kansas.

Brinkley then moved south of the border,
where Mexico licensed him to operate a powerful
"borderblaster" station in Villa Acu√±a.
Living and practicing medicine in Del Rio,
where he was licensed in Texas, he continued to
experiment, developing the techniques of electrical
transcriptions and longwire directional
antennas, which are still in use. When Mexico
increased his power to 500,000 watts, he could
reach listeners across North America. Others
imitated his borderblaster techniques, and the
resulting jumble in the airwaves led to the Treaty
of Havana of 1937, a North American agreement
to control international radio broadcasting. For
the first time Mexico received some fair share,
legally, of the airwave allotments and agreed to
bring its rogue broadcasters under control.

Once a millionaire through his unusual
medical and radio practices, Brinkley began
a rapid descent in 1939 when the American
Medical Association successfully won a suit
against him and disgruntled patients began
lawsuits. He died bankrupt in San Antonio,
Texas, on May 26, 1942, but his radio techniques
endured.
