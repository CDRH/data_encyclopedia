KANSAS CITY STAR

The Kansas City Star was born September 18,
1880, founded by William Rockhill Nelson,
who owned a construction business and the
Fort Wayne (Indiana) Sentinel, and newspaperman
Samuel Morss. The two left Fort
Wayne's economic problems and moved to
Kansas City, then a frontier boomtown with
three newspapers that each sold for a nickel.
Under "Colonel" Nelson's brash leadership
and selling for two cents, the evening Star became
a national newspaper and dominating
political force that championed honest government
and civic improvement. One of Nelson's
many crusades led to a city park system
that became a national model.

On October 19, 1901, Nelson bought a
morning competitor, the Kansas City Times,
and formed the "24-hour Star." Nelson died
April 13, 1915, leaving one of the nation's best
newspapers to heirs who ran it until it was sold
in 1926 to thirty employees for $11 million. Roy
A. Roberts, a Nelson disciple, became managing
editor in 1928. Once a Star carrier and
reporter, Roberts ultimately was president, editor,
and general manager. His powerful influence
on regional and national politics and his
political acumen helped the Star retain its
ranking among the nation's best through the
1950s.

The 1940s saw record expansion, but newsprint
shortages that began during World War
II hampered the Star's growth. In 1945 the
company purchased a Park Falls, Wisconsin,
paper mill to supply newsprint, but the cost of
mitigating the mill's pollution ultimately contributed
to the Star's sale. In 1955 the Star was
found guilty of monopolistic advertising practices.
It agreed to change practices and sell
WDAF-TV, started in 1949, and WDAF radio,
started in 1922. The controversy contributed
to a sluggishness that infiltrated some areas,
but the news-reporting operation thrived. In
1963 Roberts was succeeded by Richard B.
Fowler, whose goal was diversification. But
questionable purchases, other financial burdens,
and changing national readership habits
loomed. On February 15, 1977, Capital Cities
Communications Inc. bought the Star for $125
million.

James H. Hale, named publisher the day
sale papers were signed, made changes newspaper-
wide, cutting costs while leading expansions
and improvements that yielded record
profits. Ultimately, however, declining
circulation threatened afternoon newspapers
nationwide. The Times and Star were combined,
and the morning Star began on March
1, 1990.

On January 4, 1996, Capital Cities/ABC and
Walt Disney Company agreed to merge. Ironically,
Walt Disney had delivered the Star as a
boy, but his applications as artist, office boy,
and truck driver were rejected. Other celebrities
also had ties to the Star. Ernest Hemingway
worked there in 1917-18, and editor C. G.
"Pete" Wellington helped develop Hemingway's
writing style. On April 5, 1997, Knight-
Ridder, the nation's second-largest newspaper
company, bought the Star and three other
newspapers for $1.65 billion.

The Kansas City Star, legendary for local
coverage and attention to writing, has won
seven Pulitzer Prizes and four George Polk
Awards. Its daily circulation was at 275,535 in
2001, and the company's mission statement
reflects Nelson's legacy: "Since 1880, The Star
has been our area's preeminent communications
company because of a commitment to
one ideal: Building our community through
knowledge."
