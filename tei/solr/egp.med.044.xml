STORZ, TODD (1924-1964)

Omaha, Nebraska, radio broadcasting entrepreneur
Robert Todd Storz was described in
1956 by Time magazine as the "fastest rising
figure in U.S. radio." His Mid-Continent
Broadcasting Company and its daytime-only
kowh ruled Omaha's airwaves from 1950
through 1957 with controversial outside stunts
and station promotions, listen-to-win contests
and games, popular music, razzle-dazzle
announcers, and sensational sounding news
broadcasts that offered listeners a weekly cash
award for the best news tip. Under Storz's direct
supervision the company spawned similar
independent programming success stories
at six other radio stations acquired by the
company from 1953 through 1960, creating
one of the most innovative and profitable privately
held nonnetwork radio groups in the
history of post-World War II broadcasting.

Born in Omaha to Robert Herman Storz
and Mildred Todd Storz on May 8, 1924, Storz
developed an early interest in radio and built
a cigar-box crystal set at the age of eight. During
his early teens he was a five-meter "bootlegger,"
transmitting without a license, and
by his sixteenth year he was a licensed amateur
radio operator. He attended Omaha public
schools, leaving that city's Central High
School in 1940 to complete his secondary education
at the prestigious Choate School in
Wallingford, Connecticut. After graduating in
1942 he attended the University of Nebraska
for one year. He enlisted in the United States
Army and passed specialized Signal Corps
cryptography exams with the highest score,
becoming the youngest warrant officer in the
service.

Following World War II Storz took a
twelve-week nbc-sponsored course in radio at
Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois,
and worked at several radio stations as an announcer,
salesman, and copywriter. In 1947 he
was employed at KBON in Omaha, hosting its
1490 Swing Club program. In 1949 Todd and his
father purchased KOWH from the Omaha World Herald for $75,000. Todd, age twentyfive,
became KOWH general manager and vice
president of the new Mid-Continent Broadcasting
Company. His father, fifty, was the
company's president. By 1951 KOWH had become
the nation's top-rated independent radio
station.

In 1957 the company changed its name to the
Storz Broadcasting Company and sold KOWH
to William F. Buckley Jr.'s National Weekly,
Inc., for $822,500, an astonishing price for a
500-watt daytime-only radio station. Meanwhile,
Storz had acquired am radio stations in
New Orleans, Kansas City, Minneapolisâ€“St.
Paul, Miami, Oklahoma City, and St. Louis.
Storz was president of the highly profitable
company; his father was its chairman of the
board. Storz originated the idea of Top 40 music
programming with the purchase in 1953 of
WTIX in New Orleans.

In 1957 declining network radio revenues
prompted ABC to recruit several Storz top
management figures. As consultants, they recommended
new programming at ABC Radio,
including network news and the Top 40 music
format at several of its owned and operated
radio stations and many of its affiliates.

On April 13, 1964, Todd Storz died from an
apparent stroke at his home in Miami Beach,
Florida. In 1966 Robert H. Storz returned the
company's home office operations to Omaha
from Miami Beach. Beginning in 1978 the Storz
stations were sold separately, the last in 1985,
bringing to a close an important chapter in
American radio history.
