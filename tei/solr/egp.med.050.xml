WINNIPEG FREE PRESS

The Manitoba Free Press, precursor of the
Winnipeg Free Press (the name change took
place in 1931), printed its first edition in November
1872, only two years after Manitoba
joined the Confederation and two years before
its host city, Winnipeg, was incorporated.
The founders, John A. Kenny (publisher) and
W. F. Luxton (editor), lived above the paper's
offices in a tar-paper shack on the corner of
Main and James Streets. The early papers were
cranked out on a handpress that was surrounded
by coal-tar lamps to keep the ink
from freezing. From this rudimentary beginning
the Free Press grew with Winnipeg to become
not only Manitoba's leading newspaper
but also one of the most respected papers in
the country.

Much of the success of the Winnipeg Free Press can be attributed to two men, politician
Sir Clifford Sifton (1861-1929) and journalist
John W. Dafoe (1866-1944). Sifton took over
ownership of a rather floundering enterprise
in 1898, determined to make the paper the
voice of the Liberal Party in the Prairie Provinces.
To that end he appointed Dafoe, a young
Montreal journalist, as editor in 1901. Dafoe
edited the paper until his death. In his editorials
Dafoe championed the interests of western
Canada, strenuously argued for greater Canadian
autonomy from Britain, and promoted
the Liberal Party (though not all individuals
affiliated with it). In the 1930s his pessimistic
editorials candidly chronicled the devastation of
drought and unemployment on the Prairies,
and in 1938, alone among leading Canadian editorialists,
he refused to support the Munich
Pact.

Dafoe carefully amassed a superb cast of
journalists. For example, he appointed the talented
Cora Hind (1861–1942) as agricultural
editor in 1901, twenty years after she had been
refused a job at the paper because she was a
woman. Dafoe also nurtured the career of A.
Grant Dexter (1896–1961), who joined the
Free Press in 1912 and became one of Canada's
preeminent political journalists. Dexter went
on to edit the Free Press from 1948 to 1954.

In 1980 the Winnipeg Free Press absorbed its
main rival, the Winnipeg Tribune. By the year
2000 the paper was being read by more than
50 percent of the adults in Winnipeg, its main
market. Weekday circulation was 128,988, Saturday
circulation was 191,076, and Sunday circulation
stood at 144,588. In all, its circulation
is more than three times that of its main competitor,
the Winnipeg Sun. In 1991 the Free Press abandoned its cramped downtown offices
for a new 150-million-dollar production
plant in northwestern Winnipeg. There, three
computerized presses can each print papers at
the rate of 75,000 an hour. The Winnipeg Free Press has come a long way since Kenny and
Luxton turned out the first edition.
