HISPANIC MUSIC

Most Hispanic communities in the Great
Plains maintain Mexican and Mexican American
musical and cultural traditions, including
musical repertoires, tastes, and practices. The
maintenance and persistence of musical traditions
and preferences depends in large part on
the date of arrival in the area. More recently
arrived Mexican immigrants bring musical
styles from their home regions: mariachi music
from the state of Jalisco, harp music from
the state of Michoacán, and border music
(música norteña, featuring the accordion)
from the northern state of Nuevo León, for
example. Mexican Americans born in the
Great Plains perform, listen, and dance to
mainstream North American popular music
(rock, rap, pop, blues) and jazz, Tex-Mex musical
styles, especially the accordion-led conjunto
ensemble, and current Latin American
and Mexican popular and folk music genres:
Colombian cumbia, Caribbean salsa, Mexican
lyric canciones románticas (love songs), and
corridos (contemporary narrative ballads,
often with a strong social or political orientation).

Mexican, Chicano, and Latino popular musicians
whose work is well known and appreciated
in the Great Plains include a wide range of
artists active in a variety of musical styles: the
Latin rock group Santana (led by Mexicanborn
guitarist Carlos Santana); Los Tigres del
Norte, the música norteña band from the state
of Sinaloa noted for the performance of songs
with strong social commentary; Panamanian
salsa musician Ruben Blades; Selena Quintanilla,
the much-lamented tejana singer; tejano
conjunto accordionist Flaco Jiménez; and tejana
singer Lydia Mendoza, among others.

Hispanic Catholic and Protestant sacred
musical styles in the Great Plains have also
been influenced by developments in Mexico
and the Hispanic Southwest. In Spanish-speaking
congregations, Catholic and Protestant
sacred musical performance styles and repertoires
are related to secular styles, though
with a religious context and message. The influence
of mainstream North American popular
secular music styles can certainly be heard
in Hispanic congregations in Great Plains
states as elsewhere in the country.

Most of these musical styles and traditions
remain generally invisible to the mainstream
majority European American population in
the Great Plains region. Just as earlier Czech
and Swedish musical traditions were often
mysterious to outsiders during the peak years
of central European and Scandinavian immigration
to the Great Plains (though everyone
knew, and knows, the polka), so too are many
Hispanic musical traditions generally unfamiliar
to non-Spanish speakers today. Some
possible exceptions include Mexican mariachi
music and Tex-Mex conjunto music, with its
polka roots.

In addition to the Hispanic community's
acceptance and use of a heterogeneous mix
of Mexican, Mexican American, North American,
and Latin American popular and folk music
styles, the generally well developed public
school music education establishment in
the region embraces and involves students
of all races and ethnicities, including those
with Spanish surnames. As the number of Hispanic
students in schools in Nebraska, Kansas,
and other Great Plains states grows, so too
will their representation in marching bands,
wind ensembles, orchestras, jazz bands, and
choruses in elementary and secondary schools
in the region. Much of the repertoire, with its
emphasis on European and European American
art and popular music traditions and
jazz, performed by these musical ensembles
is situated at a distance from the popular
and folk music repertoires and styles common
in Spanish-speaking communities. However,
musical groups featuring Mexican and Latino
repertoire (especially mariachi music) have
been established in some public schools in the
region (in Fort Worth, for example) in order
to foster positive self-identification among
Hispanic students. Nevertheless, one should
not assume that Hispanic musical life and involvement
in the Great Plains is limited to only
one tradition or style. Rather, it should be considered
as a mosaic made up of many constituent
and finely nuanced parts.
