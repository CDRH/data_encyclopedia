MILLER, ROGER (1936-1992)

Roger Dean Miller
    

Roger Dean Miller was an immensely popular
country music artist and songwriter whose
witty and catchy songs dominated country
music from 1964 to 1966. Miller was born in
Fort Worth, Texas, on January 2, 1936. When
he was thirteen months old his father died, so
Miller was raised by his Uncle Elmer on a farm
in Erick, Oklahoma. There he learned to play
fiddle, banjo, and guitar. After high school,
Miller joined the army and served in Korea,
then in a country band in Special Services at
Fort McPherson in Atlanta. After the army,
Miller moved to Nashville in 1957 and pursued
a songwriting career. He also performed as a
musician, playing for Minnie Pearl, Faron
Young, and Ray Price.

His first songwriting hit was "Invitation to
the Blues," recorded by Ray Price in 1958. Other
early songwriting hits include "Half a Mind,"
recorded by Ernest Tubb, "Billy Bayou" and
"Home," recorded by Jim Reeves, and "You
Don't Want My Love," recorded by Andy Williams.
Miller recorded for Starday and then
rca Victor before signing with Mercury's
Smash label, where in 1964 he began a string of
hits with "Dang Me," followed by "Chuga-
Lug," "England Swings," "Engine Engine
Number 9," and his biggest song, "King of the
Road." Miller won five Grammys for his 1964
work and another six for his 1965 recordings.

In 1966 he hosted The Roger Miller Show on
NBC, and in 1973 he narrated the voice of the
rooster in Disney's Robin Hood. In the mid-
1980s he wrote the score for the Broadway musical
Big River, based on the novel Huckleberry Finn, for which he won a Tony Award. Miller
was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1991 and
died in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on October 25,
1992. He was inducted into the Country Music
Hall of Fame in 1995.
