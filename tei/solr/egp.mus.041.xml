Buffy Sainte-Marie is a Cree singer-songwriter,
guitarist, mouth-bow player, artist,
and educator who was born February 20, 1941,
at the Piapot Reserve in Saskatchewan, Canada.
Orphaned when a few months old, she
was raised by a part Micmac family in Massachusetts
and later adopted by a Cree family
related to her biological parents. As a college
student in the early 1960s, Sainte-Marie became
known as a social commentator, initially
in New York's Greenwich Village, then internationally
in Europe, Canada, Australia, Hong
Kong, and Japan. Her songs addressing the
plight of Native American people such as 'My
Country 'Tis of Thy People You're Dying"
(1964) generated the most controversy. Several
of her songs became widely known in versions
by other artists, including "Until It's Time for
You to Go" (recorded by Elvis Presley and
many others), "Up Where We Belong" (the
theme for the film An Officer and a Gentleman,
which won an Academy Award in 1983
for best song), and the antiwar song "The
Universal Soldier" (used as an anthem for the
1960s peace movement).

Sainte-Marie is also noted for her work as a
digital artist and as an educator. Her regular
performances on the TV show Sesame Street
(1975â€“81) taught countless children that Indians
still exist. The Cradleboard Teaching Project,
founded by Sainte-Marie in 1996, enables mainstream
school systems to communicate with
Native American communities via computer.
Currently residing in Hawaii, Sainte-Marie frequently
travels to make recordings, perform
concerts, and lecture on a variety of topics, including
electronic music, digital art, and Native
American women's issues.
