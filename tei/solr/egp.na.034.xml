HEALTH

The history of the health of Great Plains tribes
can be characterized as a series of epidemiological
transitions highlighted by several distinct
eras. Before European American colonization,
Plains peoples suffered from low-virulence infections
and socially induced mortalities. Paleopathological
evidence reveals numerous afflictions:
malnutrition, anemia, tuberculosis,
treponematosis, and other degenerative,
chronic, and congenital conditions. Together
with periodic trauma, such as accidents and
warfare, these afflictions determined morbidity
and mortality patterns.

European American contact brought elevated
levels of morbidity and mortality. Most
tribes experienced deteriorating health conditions
and sustained population declines. The
crucial factor was the introduction of Eastern
Hemisphere infectious diseases such as cholera,
influenza, measles, and smallpox. Even
before 1730 Plains populations were exposed
to epidemics. Then, between 1730 and 1877,
approximately fifty epidemics swept across the
Northern Plains; Southern Plains societies
suffered similar catastrophes. Smallpox was
particularly devastating: the 1837.38 epidemic,
for example, killed an estimated 17,200
Indians in the Northern Great Plains, including
8,160 Blackfoot.

Epidemics were accompanied by increased
warfare, impairment of subsistence activities
and consequent famine, breakdown of social
systems, which crippled a tribe's capacity to
care for its sick, and deep cultural stress. In
response, Great Plains societies employed a
number of adaptive strategies, altering their
kinship, marital, and adoption practices, and
modifying their ideological systems to explain
the introduced pathogens. Some tribes accepted
select western medical techniques,
such as vaccination, adding them to their traditional
repertoire of healing practices.

Rudimentary governmental health services
were introduced after 1819 under the auspices
of the War Department. Army physicians,
missionaries, and even traders administered
sporadic medical care. Some U.S. government
treaties promised medical care, but of the
numbered treaties in Canada, only Treaty
Number 6 (1876), with the Crees, referred specifically
to medical services. Concerted efforts
to provide health care for Plains Indians did
not occur until long after their confinement to
reservations and reserves.

Although epidemics, including influenza,
still sporadically occurred, after about 1880
the main causes of morbidity and mortality
were aÄictions brought about by the impoverished
conditions of life on the reservations
and reserves, especially tuberculosis, trachoma,
and dysentery. For example, in 1898
the high (54 per 1,000) death rate among the
Canadian Sarcee (Sarsi) was largely the result
of tuberculosis.

In response, in both the Canadian and U.S.
Great Plains a rudimentary system of health
care delivery was developed that included
hospital-based care, civilian physicians, and
field matrons. In particular, tuberculosis, trachoma,
and high infant mortality rates were
targeted. Prior to 1940, however, health care
delivery to Plains reservations and reserves
was plagued by inadequate facilities, a lack of
medical supplies, personnel problems, as well
as by a general resistance to western medicine.
Western medical practices were rejected both
because they were culturally alien and also because
they undermined Indigenous healing
and associated religious beliefs.

In Canada after World War II the responsibility
for Native health services was transferred
to Health and Welfare Canada, and
then, in the 1970s, to the Department of Indian
Affairs and Northern Development. In
the United States, since the mid-1960s the goal
of the Indian Health Service has been to bring
Native American health up to the level of the
rest of the nation. Still, the health of Native
Americans and First Nations remains well below
the national averages.

Indeed, the Native peoples of the Plains
have similar epidemiological and demographic
profiles to those found in the developing
world. They are young, poorly educated,
and have low income, and their societies are
characterized by high fertility and mortality
rates, with prevalent occurrences of chronic
diseases and social pathologies. Plains Indians
have a life expectancy that is seven years lower
than the U.S. and Canadian averages. Infant
mortality, though falling, was still 3.5 times
higher among First Nations of the Prairies
than in Canada as a whole in 1996, and in 2000
the infant mortality rate in the Aberdeen,
South Dakota, service area exceeded the national
average by more than 50 percent.

With the notable exception of another introduced
disease, the human immunodeficiency
virus that leads to AIDS, infectious diseases
on the reservations and reserves have
waned because of improvements in sanitation
and, to a degree, rising standards of living.
The three leading causes of death are now
heart disease, malignant neoplasms (tumors),
and accidents. Type 2 diabetes, hypertension,
and arthritis are also prevalent, and alcoholism,
substance abuse, homicide, and family
violence also occur at rates substantially
higher than the national averages. To one degree
or another, these are all addictions of poverty
and associated dysfunctional lifestyles
and behavior.

Although such statistics reveal how large
the gap is in health equity between Plains Indigenous
and non-Indigenous peoples, improvements
are being made on a number of
health fronts. Great Plains tribes are assuming
greater responsibility in defining their health
needs and controlling health resources. They
are integrating traditional medical practices
with western medical techniques to address
their health concerns in a culturally appropriate
manner. It is hoped that the result will be
sustained improvements in health.
