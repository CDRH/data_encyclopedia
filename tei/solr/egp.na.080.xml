PALEO-INDIANS


"Selected Paleo-Indian sites in the Great Plains"


Paleo-Indians were the earliest people to inhabit
the Americas. Between 30,000 and 11,000 years
ago, small, highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers
extended their hunting areas throughout
Beringia (the landmass that joined Siberia
and Alaska) and into the Western Hemisphere.
This "bridging landmass" emerged slowly from
beneath the Bering Sea as more than nine million
cubic miles of glacial ice accumulated over
southern Alaska, Canada, Labrador, and Greenland.
About 20,000 to 18,000 years ago an immense
"ice dome" (the Laurentide glacier) towered
more than one mile over present-day
Hudson Bay. Two lobes of ice spread southward
over the eastern edge of the Dakotas and deeper
into the Midwest. The Central and Southern
Great Plains remained unglaciated at this time,
yet the mountains of glacial ice to the north
exerted pronounced influences upon the everyday
lives of the Paleo-Indians throughout the
region.

Archeologists believe that Paleo-Indians expanded
into certain ice-free areas of North
America's interior, or along its coastal margins.
The timing of the arrival of Paleo-Indians in
the Great Plains and in North America, in general,
is under renewed investigation. Recent
genetic studies based on mitochondrial DNA
suggest that a founding population composed
of four distinct genetic lineages appeared in
the Western Hemisphere between 37,000 and
23,000 years before present (B.P.). It appears
that all contemporary Native Americans are
descendants of these Paleo-Indian lineages, including
the hunter-gatherers who made their
appearance in the Great Plains 18,000 years ago
or earlier.

During the last Ice Age, the Great Plains was
inhabited by a diverse array of animals, including
the Columbian mammoth, musk oxen,
caribou, horse, camel, bison, elk, lion, wolf, arctic
ground squirrels, arctic shrews, and lemmings.
Around 14,500 B.P. the Northern Hemisphere
began to warm and the glaciers began to
shrink. The ice over North America essentially
disappeared by 6,500 B.P. Mosaic communities
of plants and animals were reshuÄed and sorted
into their characteristic zonal patterns of today.
Many large herbivorous and carnivorous mammals
were unable to make the necessary shifts in
diet, reproduction, and morphology and became
extinct between 12,000 and 10,000 B.P.
Some scientists have attributed the disappearance
of many larger mammals to the superior
predatory abilities of the Paleo-Indians themselves.
There is little reason to believe that
Paleo-Indian hunter-gatherers had any significant
role in these global animal extinctions;
such extinctions had occurred many times before,
particularly during abrupt shifts from
colder glacial to warmer interglacial periods.

The most abundant physical evidence for
Paleo-Indians in the Plains consists of a diverse
array of carefully made chipped stone projectile
points that were given geographical placenames
like Clovis, Goshen, Folsom, Midland,
Plainview, Cody, Alberta, Hell Gap, Scottsbluff,
and Eden. Hunting weapons were probably
constructed from interchangeable parts
that were frequently repaired and recycled.
Certain chipped stone points (e.g., Clovis,
Folsom, and Goshen) were attached to short,
fletched "dart" shafts and thrown with the use
of a leverlike spear thrower, or atlatl. Paleo-
Indian flint knappers developed an extremely
efficient eleven-step method for transforming
a large flake of high-quality stone into a multipurpose
cutting implement and, later, into a
Folsom point, two "razor blades," and a "lathe"
tool. Larger stone points (e.g., Scottsbluff, Hell
Gap, and Alberta) functioned as thrusting
spears for dispatching bison that had been
driven into natural traps created by parabolic
sand dunes, deep gullies, or snowdrifts. Paleo-
Indian tool kits also included chipped stone
tools required to skin and butcher game,
scrape skins and hides, and fashion specialized
tools and component parts (e.g., foreshafts,
shaft straighteners, and delicate eyed needles)
of bone, antler, ivory, and wood.

One of the first documented discoveries of
Paleo-Indian stone tools found together with
the bones of extinct Ice Age animals in North
America was made by H. T. Martin and T. R.
Overton in 1895 near Russell Springs, Kansas. A
similar find was made by George McJunkin–a
cowboy, naturalist, and former black slave–in
1908 near Folsom, New Mexico. But it was not
until August 29, 1927, that a fluted spear or
"dart" point (Folsom) was found by archeologists
among the bones of extinct bison (Bison
antiquus) at McJunkin's Folsom site. Paleontologists,
archeologists, and anthropologists
were called to inspect this find in its undisturbed
context, and only then did the scientific
community agree that humans had lived contemporaneously
with these now-extinct animals
at the end of the last Ice Age.

These accidental finds sparked the initial
systematic studies of the Paleo-Indian presence
in the North American Great Plains.
In the 1930s Clovis projectile points (dated
11,200–10,900 B.P.) were found with the remains
of extinct Ice Age elephants (mammoths)
and also bison near Clovis, New Mexico.
Later Paleo-Indian occupations (10,000–
8,800 B.P.), including the Cody complex on
the Northern Plains and the Firstview complex
on the Southern Plains, featured a number
of chipped stone projectile points. With
the development of radiocarbon dating in the
1950s, as well as the excavation of "layer-cakelike"
sites at Blackwater Draw, New Mexico,
and Hell Gap, Wyoming, archeologists outlined
the time frame for Paleo-Indian life in
the Great Plains that is used today.

Paleo-Indians left a scant "trail" throughout
the Great Plains. Geographer Vance Holliday
has estimated that archeologists have found
roughly two Paleo-Indian campsites for each
century of their currently documented 2,400-
year-long stay in the Great Plains. In the Southern
High Plains, this means that there is one
Paleo-Indian campsite per 667 square miles
(1,733 square kilometers). Yet Paleo-Indian
sites are still being discovered, including campsites
(e.g., Mill Iron, Montana; Lake Ilo, North
Dakota; and Cattle Guard, Colorado), animal
kill sites (e.g., Waugh and Cooper sites in
Kansas), tool caches (e.g., Anzick, Montana;
Fenn, Wyoming; and Ryan, Texas), and tool
stone quarries and/or workshops (e.g., Alkali
Creek, North Dakota, and Hanson, Wyoming).

Researchers have also intensified their efforts
to revise and to reformulate their reconstructions
of past environments and Paleo-Indian
life. Archeologists had generally assumed that
the Great Plains during the late glacial period
supported a widespread boreal forest composed
predominantly of spruce trees. This spruce forest
reconstruction is not supported by a fossil
record that is dominated by grazing and browsing
mammals. Also, paleoecologists now suggest
that much, if not all, of the spruce and pine
pollen was not endemic and had actually been
deposited over the Plains by westerly winds.

Recent studies suggest that Paleo-Indian
hunter-gatherers, specifically Folsom people,
lived in small, multifamily groups. These groups
or hunting bands may have established from
twelve to thirty-six camps per year throughout
an area of more than 52,000 square miles
(slightly less than the area of North Dakota).
Folsom-age projectile points have been found
more than 300 miles (500 km) from their geological
source. It appears that Paleo-Indians
quickly located sources for the highest-quality
tool stone in the Plains, including Knife River
flint (western North Dakota), Niobrara jasper
(Nebraska), and Edwards chert (Texas).

The Great Plains has played, and continues
to play, a central role in the study of Paleo-
Indian lifeways in the Western Hemisphere.
Recent work by Steve Holen (Nebraska State
Museum) at mammoth death sites may push
the initial human occupation of the Great
Plains back to more than 18,000 years ago.
Such recent research also suggests that the earliest
Paleo-Indians may have scavenged food
from large mammal carcasses. Archeologists
are making use of refined radiocarbon dating
methods and more dynamic views of prehistoric
technology to reassess the static Paleo-
Indian "culture histories" that once dominated
their thinking. Archeologists working in
the Great Plains have now begun to bring the
faint outlines of Paleo-Indian existence into
better focus.
