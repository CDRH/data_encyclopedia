PARKER, QUANAH (ca. 1852-1911)


Quanah Parker


Born between 1845 and 1852 to the white captive
Cynthia Ann Parker and the Quahada Comanche
war chief Peta Nocona, Quanah Parker
grew up within traditional Comanche
society, but his later life was marked by a fusion
of white and Indian ways. By the time of the
1874.75 Red River War, Quanah had gained
such a su.cient following that he helped lead
the momentous attack of as many as 700 Comanches,
Kiowas, and Southern Cheyennes
against the two dozen buffalo hunters and
merchants at the Adobe Walls trading post in
the Texas Panhandle. The failure of this attack,
and subsequent army victories on the Staked
Plains, forced all the Comanches and Kiowas
to their reservation at Fort Sill in western Indian
Territory.

Because of his white ancestry and his willingness
to accept reservation life, Quanah attracted
the attention of various civilians and
military officers at Fort Sill. Agent P. B. Hunt
established him as a band chief, with authority
to preside over the issuance of beef rations
and other annuities. This provided Quanah
with significant leverage among his own people,
even to the detriment of some of the traditional
elders. By 1886 he had been appointed
one of the three judges of the Court of Indian
Offenses, and he used this position to champion
an assimilationist course.

Despite his cooperation with white authorities
and his determination to have his people
"walk the white man's road," Quanah steadfastly
honored many Comanche traditions.
He retained his long hair, participated in ancient
ceremonies, spoke mostly in the Comanche
language, and preserved the right of
polygamous marriage. The fact that he had
eight wives, five of them at one time, angered
some important whites, and in 1898 this cost
him the coveted position of Indian judge. Significantly,
however, he won his battle to serve
as a leader of the peyote religion that was expanding
rapidly among his people.

Even though Quanah drew most of his authority
as "principal chief" from whites, his
popularity among Comanches also increased,
especially because of his diplomatic skills
in negotiating leasing agreements with Texas
cattlemen. Although many tribal members
initially had opposed the leasing of tribal grazing
lands, the collective income soon guaranteed
majority support. The greatest challenge
to the reservation began in 1892 when the
Jerome Commission called for the allotment
of tribal lands into individual holdings and
the sale of all surplus acreage to white settlers.
Quanah made repeated trips to Washington
dc to fight this assault on the collective land
base and Comanche sovereignty, but, yielding
to the inevitable realities, he negotiated the
best terms possible and accepted the allotment
process in 1900.

Throughout the years of reservation life,
Quanah Parker closely aligned his personal interests
with those of the broader tribe. He received
money and other gifts from Texas cattlemen,
lived in the spacious "star house" built by
their largess, fenced several thousand acres of
tribal land for his own cattle herd and to rent to
whites, and rewarded supporters and family
members with reservation jobs through supportive
agents. Yet no one could doubt that
Quanah had gained more benefits for the tribe
then any other leader of the era. He died on
February 11, 1911. His funeral at Lawton, Oklahoma,
was the largest ever held in that region,
and was well attended by respectful Indians
and whites alike.
