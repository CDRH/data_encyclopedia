URBAN COMMUNITIES

Urban Indian communities are mainly the
products of the federal relocation program for
Native Americans following World War II,
which was associated with the "termination"
movement. The relocation impetus derived
from the harsh winter of 1947-48 on the Navajo
Reservation, where freezing conditions
resulted in starvation for both the Navajos and
their livestock. The government responded by
airdropping hay to sheep and horses and by
moving many Navajo families to Denver, Salt
Lake City, and Los Angeles. Convinced that
this drastic action had been a success, the government
sponsored a wider relocation through
the Bureau of Indian Affairs. From 1952 to 1973
an estimated 100,000 Native Americans relocated
to urban areas such as Chicago, Los Angeles,
Seattle, San Francisco, Dallas, and, in the
Great Plains, Wichita, Denver, Oklahoma City,
and Tulsa. The relocation program promised
Native Americans jobs and housing in the cities,
but it actually began a new era of federal efforts
to assimilate Native peoples into the mainstream
culture of America.

The first Indian relocatees were so-called
gatekeepers who helped each other in this urban
frontier experience. In the 1950s and 1960s
urban Indians lacked su.cient education and
needed job skills to compete successfully in
the cities. Many did not make this adjustment,
and becoming frustrated, they returned to
their reservation or resorted to drink. A second
generation of Native Americans migrated
to the cities in the 1960s and 1970s, often settling
near relatives who were already living
there. By the 1980s this generation had grown
up in the cities and felt closer to Indian friends
and relatives there than to those on reservations.
They did not know the reservation culture
like their parents and grandparents, although
they did visit on a regular basis. They
developed an urban Indian culture quite unlike
the way of life on the reservation. Urban
Indian centers, which had been established in
the early 1970s with government funding, became
stronger, with more independent funding
and community support. They provided
counseling and sponsored bowling leagues,
softball teams, and other outings for their Indian
communities. Such centers–in the Great
Plains at Fort Worth, Oklahoma City, Tulsa,
Wichita, Lincoln, Denver, Rapid City, and
Sioux Falls, for example–brought together
Native Americans from different tribes, creating
a new overall Indian identity.

Los Angeles became the largest urban Indian
community, drawing Native Americans from all
over the United States but mainly from the
Southwest and Oklahoma. About 113,000 Native
Americans lived in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan
area by 1997. In the Great Plains in the
late 1990s, about 25,000 Native Americans,
mostly Navajos and Lakotas, called Denver their
home; 22,000 to 25,000 Cherokees, Choctaws,
Chickasaws, Creeks, and Seminoles, and various
Southern and Northern Plains tribes lived in
Dallas–Fort Worth; 48,196 Native Americans,
drawn mainly from the Five Civilized Tribes and
eastern Oklahoma tribes, resided in Tulsa; and
45,720 of the Five Civilized Tribes and western
Oklahoma tribes lived in Oklahoma City.
Smaller, but significant, Native American populations
also lived in Rapid City (10,000 to 12,000,
mainly Lakotas) and Sioux Falls (12,000 to
15,000, also mainly Lakotas) in South Dakota
and in Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska (with
10,000 and 1,150 Poncas, Lakotas, and Omahas,
respectively).
