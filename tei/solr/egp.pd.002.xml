ABERHART, WILLIAM (1878-1943)

William "Bible Bill" Aberhart was a dominating
figure in Alberta political, religious, and
educational life during the first half of the
twentieth century. Born in Perth County, Ontario,
on December 30, 1878, Aberhart moved
to Calgary in 1910. While serving as a respected
high school principal for the next twenty-five
years, he became increasingly involved in Baptist
lay preaching, founded the fundamentalist
Calgary Prophetic Bible Institute in 1927, and
successfully established himself as a pioneer
radio evangelist.

By the early 1930s the plight of many Albertans,
ravaged by drought and economic depression,
was desperate. Aberhart's preaching
began to incorporate a personalized version of
the "social credit" doctrines of the British economic
thinker Maj. C. H. Douglas, and Prophetic
Bible Institute study groups became the
nucleus of a provincewide Social Credit crusade.
After attempting unsuccessfully to convince
the United Farmers of Alberta government
to adopt social credit policies, he moved
in 1934 to transform Social Credit into a fullblown
political party.

Aberhart's brand of "social credit" resonated
with the traditional Alberta mix of
"radical" economic panaceas, grassroots democracy,
and Christianity. Political opponents
dismissed his program of twenty-fivedollar
monthly dividends and attacks on the
financial establishment's "Fifty Bigshots" as
"funny money" nonsense, and they branded
Aberhart himself as a dangerous charlatan. Yet
attempts to discredit Aberhart and his message
mattered little to growing numbers of
small businessmen, urban workers, and farmers;
it was enough that he promised action and
offered hope.

Aberhart's Social Credit swept into power
in 1935 with 54 percent of the popular vote and
fifty-six of sixty-three legislative seats. By
merely advocating the control, not the elimination,
of capitalism, Aberhart's version of
"social credit" had appealed to those who rejected
the capitalist status quo but feared embracing
the socialist Cooperative Commonwealth
Federation.

When "dividends" to increase the purchasing
power of the poor failed to materialize,
Premier Aberhart claimed Albertans had only
voted for "good government." Nevertheless, a
caucus insurgency fueled by grassroots discontent
finally compelled passage of "social
credit" financial and economic legislation in
1937-38, only to have it promptly ruled unconstitutional.
Thereafter, disillusioned with
Aberhart's authoritarian leadership style and
his government's failure to act aggressively
enough on social and economic reforms,
many radical Social Creditors abandoned the
party. Press-gag legislation designed to muzzle
political criticism further alienated the establishment
and frightened intellectuals across
the country. Fortunately for Aberhart, a less
dramatic agenda of health and education reforms,
as well as legislative measures favorable
to small business and consumers, enabled Social
Credit to stave off stiff challenges from the
right and the left in 1940.

World War II revived Alberta's economy
and made governing easier, and major oil discoveries
immediately following the war altered
the province's economy and society almost
beyond recognition. The political legacy
of William Aberhart, who died suddenly in
Vancouver on May 23, 1943, remains controversial.
Few disagree, however, that the rightwing
path along which he intended to lead the
party, and which his protégé and successor,
Ernest Manning, would take it during his long
tenure as Social Credit premier, was clear after
1940.
