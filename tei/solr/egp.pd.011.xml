BROWDER, EARL (1891-1973)

Leader of the American Communist Party
(CPUSA) during the movement's heyday, Earl
Russell Browder was born into an impoverished,
radicalized Wichita, Kansas, family on
May 20, 1891. Forced to leave school before
completing third grade, he rose eventually
to become an accountant, while wandering
around Kansas City leftist movements. World
War I draft resistance sent him to Leavenworth
Penitentiary in 1919. Upon release, he
located New York Leninists and soon led a
delegation to Moscow. There, he befriended
Soviet labor expert Solomon Lozovsky. Between
1922 and 1926 Browder assisted domestic
working-class hero William Z. Foster and
supported Joseph Stalin, who was bureaucratizing
the Soviet Union's revolutionary state.
In 1926 Browder married Raissa Luganovskaya,
a former Russian commissar of justice,
who pestered Lozovsky to give Browder a career
break. Covert work for the Communist
International (Comintern) in China quickly
followed. By 1932 Browder led the cpusa, and
soon he was championing Comintern head
Georgi Dimitrov's antifascist Popular Front
policy, which sought to replace revolution
with reformism and advocated collective security
with the Soviet Union against Germany.
Rapidly the Communists became the
largest political party left of the Democrats,
bringing unprecedented influence.

In 1939 the Soviet Union signed a nonaggression
treaty with Nazi Germany, abandoning
the tactic of collective security.
Browder vacillated, caught between the Soviet
Union's demands and domestic radical needs.
In 1941 the U.S. government sent him to Atlanta
Penitentiary on an ancient passport
technicality. Amid a national "Red Scare," the
cpusa hastily broke official Comintern ties. In
June 1941 Germany invaded Russia, and that
December the United States entered the war,
making possible the Grand Alliance between
the Soviet Union and the Western powers.
Communists gave the conflict their total support,
and President Franklin D. Roosevelt
freed Browder on May 16, 1942.

Unlike his experience in Leavenworth twenty
years earlier, imprisonment in Atlanta left
Browder with permanent psychological damage.
Wisely, in 1938 he had secured his sister's
release from Soviet secret police work, citing his
own high profile. Yet recklessly he maintained
espionage contacts because of curiosity, a need
to outpace former mentor Foster (now a rival),
and to impress the Russians. In 1943 Stalin disbanded
the Comintern. Browder, ever vain, assumed
he now led an independent Communist
movement. By 1944 he considered himself a
world Marxist thinker, akin to Chou En-lai.
Browder converted the CPUSA into a leftist pressure
group, the Communist Political Association.
He thereby abandoned the movement's
Leninist vanguard role. Once Allied victory
became inevitable, a message from Moscow
brought the cpusa's reconstitution and Browder's
expulsion. He spent his remaining years a
pariah and died on June 27, 1973, unmourned by
any Communist publications.
