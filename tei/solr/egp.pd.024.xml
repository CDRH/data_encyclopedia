GRAIN GROWERS ASSOCIATIONS

Western Canada became a cereal grain and
mixed agriculture region as the result of deliberate
public and private initiatives that were
geared to facilitating the creation of a domestic
industrial economy in Canada. The famous
"national policy" implemented by successive
Canadian governments after 1878 was actually
a series of policies. The three foundational
policies were the establishment of protective
tariffs, the promotion of western settlement,
and the construction of a transcontinental
railroad. An expanding agricultural population
in the West was to provide export cash
crops and serve as a captive market for Canadian
industry, with the Canadian Pacific Railway
providing transportation. Although it
took longer to come to fruition than the business
and political leaders had envisioned, after
1900 Canada did in fact experience an economic
boom. There were, however, underlying
structural problems, especially in the
West.

The market relations that Prairie farmers
engaged in with the grain trade were inherently
incompatible because farmers' incomes
were dependent on maximizing the price they
received for their products, while the profits of
grain dealers were maximized by minimizing
what they paid the farmer. As a result, farmers
began to complain about the trading, marketing,
and pricing actions of the grain trade.
Given the importance of Prairie settlement in
the overall national policy, the Canadian government
was quick to intervene. Before 1900
the first of several Royal Commissions investigated
the grain trade. The end result of the
First Commission was a major regulatory initiative,
the Manitoba Grain Act, passed in 1901.
The act was designed to regulate and supervise
the grain trade so as to provide fair practices
and prices. Problems persisted, however.

As a result of a bumper crop in western
Canada in 1901, many farmers found themselves
unable to market their crops because
the grain companies and the Canadian Pacific
Railroad were not adhering to the provisions
of the Manitoba Grain Act. In order to redress
the situation, farmers in what was then the
Northwest Territories organized a meeting to
discuss their options. Organizers were optimistic
that they could get twelve people
to attend their meeting in Indian Head (in
present-day Saskatchewan), but when the
doors opened, about seventy farmers were
waiting. The farmers decided to form a nonpartisan
organization to represent their interests,
and the Territorial Grain Growers Association
(TGGA) was born. A year later, when the
TGGA held its first general meeting, its membership
was 500.

The TGGA deliberately and explicitly did not
affiliate with any political party; rather, it was
to be the voice of all farmers. As settlement
proceeded and new communities developed,
locals of the TGGA were established. By 1902
the member of Parliament from the region
was bringing resolutions and motions dealing
with grain-handling problems, passed at the
annual TGGA meetings and by TGGA locals, to
the House of Commons, where they were typically
enacted as amendments to the Manitoba
Grain Act. The farmers had discovered that
collectively they could wield considerable political
power.

Perhaps the greatest boost to the stature of
the tgga came in 1902 when the organization
addressed the continuing problems associated
with grain boxcar allocations. It appeared that
the Canadian Pacific was ignoring the provisions
of the Manitoba Grain Act in its allocation
of grain cars. After an unsuccessful visit
to the company's offices in Winnipeg, the
TGGA convinced the federal government to lay
a court charge against the railroad. The company
was convicted and forced to comply with
the provisions of the legislation. The court
victory demonstrated the effectiveness of collective
action, and the membership of the
TGGA grew even faster. In Manitoba a branch
was formed under the name the Manitoba
Grain Growers Association. In the years that
followed, the TGGA worked closely with its
Manitoba counterpart, regularly visiting Ottawa
to lobby the government for action on
various matters.

When the provinces of Saskatchewan and
Alberta were established in 1905, the former
Territorial Grain Growers Association disappeared.
However, the change was in name only.
The name of the Saskatchewan section was
changed to the Saskatchewan Grain Growers
Association (SGGA), and it went on to play an
important role in regional and national economic
and political developments. The SGGA
was instrumental in the establishment of subsequent
Royal Commissions to investigate the
grain trade, as well as in dispatching Prairie
firebrand E. A. Partridge to investigate the
Winnipeg Grain Exchange, a development that
ultimately produced one of the region's first
major farmers' cooperative grain companies.
While the SGGA experienced internal conflict
and eventually fragmented over the question
of direct political participation, it and its predecessor
laid the foundation for much of the
collective activity that shaped the region.
