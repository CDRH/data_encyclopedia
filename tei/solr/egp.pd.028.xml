HARPER, ELIJAH (b. 1949)

As the Manitoba legislature's only Aboriginal
member, Elijah Harper played a major role in
defeating the Meech Lake Accord. A Cree Indian,
Elijah was born in his parents' log cabin
on March 3, 1949, at Red Sucker Lake near the
Manitoba and Ontario border. One of thirteen
children, he spent much time with his
paternal grandparents, living in their home
but seeing his parents everyday. When he was
five years old, he became ill and spent six
months under the auspices of the Indian Affairs
medical staff without any contact with
his parents. He left home to pursue an education,
marrying during his second year as a
university student in Winnipeg. After being
active in Native organizations and issues, he
and his family returned home, where he was
elected chief of Red Sucker Lake in 1978. Three
years later he was elected as a New Democrat
member for the vast Rupert's Land riding,
with about 70 percent of the vote. From his
remote reservation he forced Aboriginal issues
into the constitutional debate.

Attempting to accommodate Quebec and
preserve Canada, the Meech Lake Accord proclaimed
that Canada had two distinct founding
nations. Harper agreed that Quebec's society
was distinct but regarded the exclusion
of Native peoples from Canada's founding nations
as offensive, as did most Native organizations.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
and the provincial premiers signed the Meech
Lake Accord on June 9, 1990. After the signing
ceremony the legislatures of Manitoba, Newfoundland,
and New Brunswick faced a twoweek
deadline to approve. Harper delayed the
vote on the accord forty-eight hours, and a
procedural mistake also delayed the accord's
introduction to the Manitoba legislature.
When debate extension required unanimous
consent, Harper again objected, preventing a
vote before the deadline expired. His quiet refusal,
with an eagle feather in hand, embodied
Native resentment over recent and historic
mistreatment. Harper became a national symbol
for Native issues. He is also a controversial
figure, however, and at times he has appeared
to be prone to political self-destruction, such
as when he refused to take a Breathalyzer test
following a minor traffic accident.
