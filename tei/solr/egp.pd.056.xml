UNITED FARMERS OF CANADA, SASKATCHEWAN SECTION

An agrarian protest organization that enjoyed
considerable popularity from the late 1920s to
the 1940s, the United Farmers of Canada, Saskatchewan
Section (UFCSS), was founded in
1926 as a result of a merger between the Farmers
Union of Canada and the Saskatchewan
Grain Growers Association (SGGA). The two
groups had formerly been rivals; in fact, the
Farmers Union of Canada was established in
response to what its members saw as a conservative
SGGA leadership that was too closely
tied to the provincial government and that
had lost touch with rank and file farmers. The
amalgamation was ratified at the UFCSS's inaugural
meeting in 1927, and long-serving agrarian
activist E. A. Partridge was chosen honorary
president.

The UFCSS was part of a tradition of dissent
on the Canadian Prairies that began to take
root in the early 1900s and took shape during a
period in which other agrarian organizations
(such as the Progressive Party and United
Farmers of Alberta) exerted considerable influence
in federal and provincial politics. At
the time of the UFCSS's establishment, the
United Farm Women of Saskatchewan (UFWS)
was also formed. The UFWS worked with the
men on several initiatives and also independently
on women's issues. Although it experienced
problems common to women's organizations
that work within male-dominated
groups, ufws members enjoyed more influence
than women in most other agrarian
associations.

In 1928 the ufcss passed a resolution that
called upon the government to compel all farmers
to market their wheat through the Saskatchewan
Wheat Pool. To convince farmers of the
benefits of the "100 percent pool" plan, American
cooperator Aaron Sapiro was recruited to
speak on the need for all farmers to participate
in the venture. The issue split the ufcss and the
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, as the latter body
maintained that compulsory legislation would
destroy the movement. In addition to cooperative
marketing, the ufcss steadfastly supported
other forms of cooperation.

Initially, the ufcss opposed direct political
action. Members disliked partisan politics and
believed that contesting elections detracted
farmers from more important goals, such as
controlling the marketing of their produce.
Thus, it chose instead to focus on lobbying
and education. In the latter field, it embarked
upon a program that occasionally competed
with that of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool.

The onset of the Great Depression drove the
ufcss toward direct political action, which it
officially endorsed in 1931. Stressing "industrial
action" (rather than concentrating on farm
issues, as some organizations did), in 1932 the
ufcss merged with the small but influential
provincial Independent Labour Party and became
known as the Saskatchewan Farmer-Labour
Group. Soon after, this body became
the Saskatchewan Section of the Cooperative
Commonwealth Federation.

In 1946 the UFCSS supported the Alberta
Farmers Union's strike, which generated conflict
within the movement and with the Saskatchewan
Wheat Pool. In 1948 the UFCSS reorganized
and was renamed the Saskatchewan
Farmers Union. By 1954, it had more than
72,000 members. In the ensuing years, however,
with a few exceptions, membership declined.
In 1969 the Saskatchewan Farmers
Union and other organizations merged to
form the National Farmers Union.
