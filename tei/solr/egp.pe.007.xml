BADLANDS

"View of Badlands National Park"


Badlands are a form of intense gullying that
results from a combination of four factors: clayrich
material, such as shale, that inhibits water
penetration; limited vegetation to impede runoff
of precipitation; rainfall concentrated in
scattered, intense showers; and downcutting of
the drainage system. The four factors cause an
intricate, fine-textured drainage network that is
characterized by many V- shaped, straight-sided
gullies divided by knifelike ridges.

Principal badland areas in the Great Plains
are at Badlands National Park in southwestern
South Dakota, Theodore Roosevelt National
Park in western North Dakota, and Dinosaur
Provincial Park in southern Alberta. Shales of
the White River Group (Oligocene), including
the Chadron and Brule Formations, form the
badlands in South Dakota and northwestern
Nebraska. Shales of the Fort Union Formation
(Paleocene) form them in North Dakota and
eastern Montana, and Cretaceous shales shape
the badlands in Alberta. Other, more isolated
areas of badlands occur in the Great Plains,
typically where impermeable shales outcrop
at the land surface and are subject to the conditions
named above. Generally, badlands are
common along the Little Missouri and Cheyenne
Rivers in the Dakotas and along the
White River north of Pine Ridge, as at Toadstool
State Park in northwestern Nebraska and
at Badlands National Park.
