THUNDERSTORMS

Thunderstorms are an integral part of the
Great Plains climate and provide a significant
proportion of total precipitation. Lightning,
moderate to heavy rainfall, strong winds, and
frequently hail accompany these events. Thunderstorm
season varies greatly from south to
north, but it generally coincides with the growing
season for crops, contributing to the rains
needed for successful dryland agriculture. In
the Central and Southern Plains, thunderstorms
are most frequent in spring and early
summer, with a secondary maximum in the
fall. In the Canadian Prairies May through
September is thunderstorm season. The number
of days per year with thunderstorms ranges
from twenty-five to thirty at observation stations
in the Prairie Provinces to forty-five to
fifty in Plains portions of Kansas, Oklahoma,
and Colorado.

Some thunderstorms reach an intensity that
causes damage and are referred to as severe
thunderstorms. These storms may produce
flash flooding and erosion, large hail, intense
lightning, damaging winds, and even tornadoes.
Rainfalls of several inches in an hour or
less occur throughout the Great Plains. Hail is
common in severe thunderstorms and may be
large and/or abundant, causing heavy losses to
both crops and property. Hailstones the size of
softballs have fallen on numerous occasions,
and the Great Plains holds records for the
largest hailstones documented in both the
United States (Coffeyville, Kansas, September
1970, 51.2 inches diameter) and Canada (Cedoux,
Saskatchewan, August 1973, almost 4Â½
inches diameter).
