TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS

Topographic maps show the general configuration
of the land surface, including its relief
and the position of natural and man-made
features. The configuration is shown commonly
by contour lines, imaginary lines connecting
all points of equal elevation on the
earth's surface above or below a datum plane
such as mean sea level. When the land slope is
steeper the contour lines are closer together.
Topographic maps at scales of one inch to a
mile or greater (shown as 1:63,360 on the map)
are used in many ways. They are particularly
important in preparation of various types of
geologic maps and cross sections that can be
used in locating, for example, mineral resources
or aquifers.

Explorations of the geology and natural resources
of the American West were initiated
by the King, Wheeler, Hayden, and Powell
Surveys from 1867 to 1879, but major topographic
mapping efforts began only after 1881.
In December 1885 John Wesley Powell, second
director of the U.S. Geological Survey, testified
before a joint committee of Congress
about the national need for topographic maps
of the country. He said that topographic mapping
of the country could be completed in
twenty-four years. By 1894 about one-fifth of
the United States was depicted on topographic
maps. Mapping of the U.S. Great Plains at a
scale of 1:24,000 was completed in 1994 by the
U.S. Geological Survey. Topographic maps of
the Canadian Prairie Provinces have been
completed at a scale of 1:50,000 by the Canada
Map Office.
