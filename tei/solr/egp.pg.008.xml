BUSH, GEORGE H. W. (b. 1924)

George Herbert Walker Bush served as the
forty-first president of the United States. One
of three persons elected to the presidency
from Texas, Bush shares with John Adams the
distinction of having seen his son inaugurated
to the presidency.

Bush was born in Milton, Massachusetts,
on June 12, 1924, the son of Prescott and Dorothy
Walker Bush. His father served as a Republican
senator from Connecticut from 1953
to 1965. George Bush grew up in Greenwich,
Connecticut, and attended Yale University. In
1942 he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a pilot and
flew fifty-eight combat missions in the Pacific.
After the war he returned to Yale and graduated
in 1948. He married Barbara Pierce in
1945. They had six children: George W., Robin
(who died of leukemia at the age of three),
John (Jeb), Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy.

After graduating from college, Bush moved
to Odessa, Texas, to begin a career in the oil
industry. He cofounded the Zapata Petroleum
Corporation in Midland in 1953. In 1958 he
moved the company's headquarters to Houston,
where he became active in Republican
politics. In 1964 he ran as a Republican for a
seat in the U.S. Senate but lost to Democrat
Ralph Yarborough. Two years later he won a
seat in the U.S. House of Representatives and
was reelected in 1968. In 1970 Bush decided to
run for the Senate again, but he lost to Democrat
Lloyd Bentsen, who had defeated the
more liberal Yarborough in the Democratic
Party primary.

Following Bush's defeat by Bentsen, President
Richard Nixon appointed Bush as permanent
representative of the United States to
the United Nations. In 1973 he became chairman
of the Republican National Committee.
After Nixon resigned the presidency in the
wake of the Watergate scandal in 1974, his successor,
Gerald R. Ford, appointed Bush as U.S.
ambassador to China and then director of the
Central Intelligence Agency. He returned to
private life after Ford's defeat in the 1976 presidential
election by Democrat Jimmy Carter.

In 1980 Bush ran for the Republican nomination
for president of the United States. Although
he won several primary elections, he
lost the party's nomination to former California
governor Ronald Reagan. Reagan asked
Bush to serve as the Republican candidate for
vice president, and the Reagan-Bush ticket
easily defeated Carter and his running mate,
Walter Mondale, in the general election.

Bush served as Reagan's vice president from
1981 to 1989. The Reagan-Bush ticket was reelected
in a landslide in 1984. Although some
conservative Republicans were skeptical of
Bush's commitment to conservative policies,
Bush was nominated by the Republicans as
their presidential candidate in 1988. He and
his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana,
defeated the Democratic nominees, Gov.
Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts and Senator
Bentsen.

Bush was inaugurated on January 20, 1989.
During his administration, communist governments
in eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union collapsed. In 1990 Iraqi dictator Saddam
Hussein took over Kuwait. After Saddam
declined to restore Kuwait's independence,
Bush assembled an international coalition to
expel Iraq from Kuwait. He received congressional
approval to use force, and early in 1991
the U.S.-led coalition used air and ground assaults
to oust the Iraqis from Kuwait. Bush also
initiated discussions with Mexico and Canada
that would lead eventually to the establishment
of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Bush's foreign policy successes in the Middle
East, eastern Europe, and elsewhere won
him widespread popularity. Few anticipated
that he would have difficulty being reelected
in 1992. However, Bush's opponents accused
him of neglecting the economy and other domestic
issues. With a recession in 1990 and
1991, and increasing levels of unemployment,
he was portrayed as being out of touch with,
and unsympathetic to, the difficulties faced by
poor and middle-class Americans. He was renominated
in 1992 but lost the general election
to Democrat Bill Clinton. A third candidate,
Ross Perot, won nearly 20 percent of the
vote and may have taken enough votes away
from Bush to secure Clinton's victory in the
general election.

After his defeat by Clinton, Bush retired
from public life. However, he had the satisfaction
of seeing two of his sons achieve high
public office. His oldest son, George W. Bush,
was elected governor of Texas in 1994 and 1998
and president in 2000. Son Jeb was elected
governor of Florida in 1998.
