DEMOCRATIC PARTY

The noted Oklahoma humorist Will Rogers
once said, "I belong to no organized party; I'm a
Democrat." Rogers's jest conveyed more than a
grain of truth. American political parties are
nonexclusive in the sense that there are no formal
membership requirements other than selfdeclaration
when registering to vote. American
political parties are also quite loosely organized,
with considerable variation in organizational
structure and ideological stance from place to
place. The most important roles of American
political parties involve the recruitment and selection
of candidates for offices at local, state,
and national levels. But the importance of local
interests and the fragmented nature of political
power under the American federal system render
unanimity on policy issues quite unlikely.

The antecedents of the modern Democratic
Party can be traced to the embryonic Democratic-
Republican faction formed under the
leadership of James Madison and Thomas
Jefferson near the end of the eighteenth century.
Democratic-Republican candidates were
most successful in frontier settings away from
the Tidewater commercial core of the young
Republic. In 1800 Jefferson defeated Federalist
incumbent John Adams. Shortly after winning
the presidency, Jefferson put aside his own
concerns about centralized authority to successfully
negotiate the Louisiana Purchase of
1803, which brought much of the territory of
the Great Plains under American sovereignty.

The Democratic Party is usually deemed to
have been formed by supporters of Andrew
Jackson who split away from the vanishing
Democratic-Republican Party in 1828. The
Democratic Party was the first to hold a national
convention, to renominate Jackson for
president in 1832. The Democratic National
Committee was initially formed in 1848 to give
the party continuity between quadrennial national
nominating conventions. But whichever
date of origin is selected–1800, 1828, 1832,
or even 1848–the Democratic Party is generally
recognized as the oldest political party still
in existence in the entire world.

From 1828 until 1856 the Jacksonian Democratic
coalition of Southern white planters,
Irish Catholic immigrant laborers, and western
frontiersmen was often successful against
the opposing Whig coalition of Yankee merchants,
"native" English Protestants, and successful
midwestern farmers. But Democrats
divided sharply over slavery into northern
and southern factions, losing the presidency
to Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860. The
Republican Party became nationally dominant
after the Civil War. The Democratic
Party regained strength in the South after Reconstruction,
and it also managed to attract
considerable support among immigrants in
northern cities. However, between 1860 and
1928 Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson
were the only Democrats elected to the White
House.

The post–Civil War geography of party
support in the Great Plains echoed that of the
United States as a whole. Republicans dominated
from Kansas northward, while Democrats
won sweeping electoral victories as soon
as federal troops were withdrawn after Reconstruction.
For example, in the three U.S. Congresses
between 1885 and 1890, every single
one of the U.S. senators and all but one of
the U.S. representatives from the Central and
Northern Plains states of Colorado, Wyoming,
Montana, Kansas, Nebraska, and North
and South Dakota were Republicans; and
every single one of the U.S. senators and representatives
from Texas were Democrats. Oklahoma
and New Mexico had not yet been
admitted to the Union, but they too would
become strongly Democratic after their admission
in the early twentieth century.

The end of the nineteenth century was an
economically and politically tumultuous period
in the Great Plains. Drought and low agricultural
product prices pressured farmers to
demand relief. Reform pledges by Greenback
and Populist Party candidates began to draw
farmers and townsfolk dependent upon farmers
away from their traditional party loyalties.
Populist or Populist-Democratic fusion candidates
did well in the Central and Northern
Plains, winning several U.S. House or U.S. Senate
seats in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North
and South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming in
elections from 1890 to 1902. In Texas, where
"Bourbon" Democrats dominated, white
agrarian Populists joined with black Republicans
to win fusion Populist-Republican seats
in the U.S. House of Representatives in each
election between 1896 and 1900.

William Jennings Bryan was the most notable
Plains Democrat of the period. Agrarian
unrest swept Republicans from Nebraska's
U.S. House delegation in the 1890 election,
and Bryan was elected to the House of Representatives
from Nebraska's First District. The
"Boy Orator of the Platte" made his famous
"Cross of Gold" speech to the Democratic National
Convention in 1896 criticizing tight fiscal
policies and calling for several reforms, in
cluding greater regulation of railroads and imposition
of an income tax in order to expand
federal relief efforts. The speech convinced wavering
delegates to nominate the "Great Commoner"
for president. Bryan was also nominated
for the presidency by the Populist Party
and by the Silver Party in 1896. After a hard-fought
campaign, Bryan lost to Republican
William McKinley in the popular and the electoral
votes. Bryan carried all the Great Plains
states except North Dakota. Bryan was again
nominated for president in 1900 and 1908, losing
the rematch to McKinley in 1900 and to
Republican William Howard Taft in 1908.

The Populist alliance, involving struggling
farmers in the South and West, blacks in the
South, and recent immigrants in the northern
industrial centers, sent shock waves through
American politics. Newspapers in eastern financial
centers were nearly unanimous in
condemning Bryan's proposed Populist reforms,
such as relaxing the gold standard, instituting
an income tax, and providing for direct
election of U.S. senators. Because of their
own aversion to mobilizing immigrant workers
and low-income farmers, northern Republican
elites looked away while southern
Democratic elites pushed enactment of "Jim
Crow" laws to restrict voting by blacks and
disadvantaged whites. Voter participation
rates plummeted in several southern states
from well over half of the potential electorate
in 1896 to less than one-quarter in the early
twentieth century. In Texas the total number
of presidential votes cast plunged from more
than 540,000 in 1896 to 231,000 in 1904.

For much of the next century Republicans
continued to dominate the Central and
Northern Plains and Democrats the Southern
Plains. However, the Populist influence, reflecting
voter dissatisfaction with dominant
eastern political and economic interests, affected
voters in both parties throughout the
region over much of the twentieth century.
Populist-oriented Democrats have been elected
to major offices across the Central and
Northern Plains, and populist-oriented Republicans
have won elections in the Southern
Plains. Many of these persons played major
roles in the political history of the twentieth-century
United States.

Although Democrats in the South are generally
more conservative than those elsewhere,
many southern Democrats elected from the
Plains states have been noted for their populist
and progressive ideas. Their progressive backgrounds
and ideas have helped several achieve
national prominence. The regularity with
which Democratic incumbents were reelected
in the Southern Great Plains states tended
to bestow advantages under the congressional
seniority system. Among those who served as
speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives
were Texans John Nance Garner (1931–33),
Sam Rayburn (1940–47, 1949–53, and 1955–
61), and James Wright (1987–89), as well as
Oklahoman Carl Albert (1971–77). On the
Senate side, Democratic majority leaders have
included Lyndon Baines Johnson of Texas
(1955–61) and Thomas A. Daschle of South
Dakota (from 2001–3). Johnson was minority
leader from 1953 to 1955, as was Daschle from
1995 to 2001 and again in 2003. Two other
prominent Plains Democrats in the House
of Representatives were George Mahon of
Lubbock, Texas, who served fifteen years as
chair of the House Appropriations Committee
(1964–1979), and Marvin Jones of
Amarillo, who was chair of the House Agriculture
Committee in the 1930s and early
1940s and played a critical role in the enactment
of New Deal farm legislation.

National legislative leadership roles proved
to be stepping-stones for two of the Texas
Democrats, Garner and Johnson. Garner was
elected twice as vice president (1933–41) under
Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Johnson was
elected vice president on the Democratic ticket
with John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts in 1960.
Johnson then succeeded to the presidency in
1963 following Kennedy's assassination in Dallas
and was elected to the presidency in his
own right in 1964. Other nationally prominent
Plains state Democrats include U.S. Sen.
George McGovern (1963–81) of South Dakota,
who ran unsuccessfully as Democratic nominee
for president in 1972, and U.S. Sen. Robert
Kerrey (1989–2001) of Nebraska, who contested
for the Democratic presidential nomination
in 1992 and 1996. Hubert Humphrey,
who represented Minnesota but was born and
raised in South Dakota, served as vice president
under Johnson from 1965 to 1969 and ran
unsuccessfully as the Democratic nominee for
president in 1968.

The long-term pattern of Democratic dominance
in the Southern Plains and Republican
dominance in the Central and Northern Plains
was never complete, and it was less apparent at
the end of the twentieth century than it had
been at the beginning. When the partisan affiliations
of state governors are examined, it
is found that eighty Democrats, seventy-three
Republicans, and three Independents or Populists
served as governor of a Great Plains state
between 1900 and 1949. However, there was a
fairly sharp geographical division. Among the
three Southern Plains states of Texas, Oklahoma,
and New Mexico, the gubernatorial
split was thirty-eight Democrats and four Republicans.
Among seven Plains states to the
north, the gubernatorial split from 1900 to
1949 was forty-two Democrats, sixty-nine Republicans,
and three Independents or Populists.
This pattern changed dramatically in the
last half of the twentieth century. Again examining
the partisan affiliations of governors, it
can be noted that all twenty Texas governors
elected between 1898 and 1978 were Democrats.
From 1978 to 2001, however, Texas had
four Republican and three Democratic governors.
For all ten Great Plains states from 1950 to
2000, the gubernatorial partisan division was
fifty-one Democrats and fifty-nine Republicans.
Among the three Southern Plains states
of Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, the
numbers were twenty-three Democrats and
fourteen Republicans, while among the remaining
seven northern Plains states the numbers
were twenty-eight Democrats and fortyfive
Republicans.

Clearly, the partisanship changes were much
more significant in the Southern Plains than in
the Central and Northern Plains. Among the
latter states, Democrats held 37 percent of all
governorships from 1900 to 1949, compared
with 38 percent of all governorships from 1950
to 2000. Among Southern Plains states, however,
the Democratic proportion of all governorships
fell from 90 percent during 1900 to
1949, to 62 percent during 1950 to 2000.

Similar patterns can be found while looking
at U.S. congressional delegations from the region.
In 1900 the Central and Northern Plains
states elected three Democrats, thirteen Republicans,
and three Populists to the U.S.
House of Representatives, compared with
thirteen Democrats and no Republicans from
Southern Plains states. In 1950 the Central and
Northern Plains states elected three Democrats
and eighteen Republicans to the U.S.
House, while the Southern Plains states elected
twenty-nine Democrats and two Republicans.
In 2000 the Central and Northern Plains
states sent three Democrats and thirteen Republicans
to the U.S. House, while Southern
Plains states elected nineteen Democratic and
twenty Republican U.S. representatives. Between
1950 and 2000 the Democratic share of
the Southern Plains delegation in the U.S.
House of Representatives fell from more than
90 percent to less than half.

These data illustrate that Democrats have
been a minority party for most of the twentieth
century in the Central and Northern
Plains, although they have won a fair share
of elections and produced a number of eminent
national leaders. In the Southern Plains
the Democrats have lost their once-dominant
position, and today the Democrats are less
successful in presidential, gubernatorial, and
congressional elections in the region than was
the case in the past.
