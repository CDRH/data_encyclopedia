FRAZIER, LYNN (1874-1947)

Lynn J. Frazier, governor and U.S. senator from
North Dakota, was born in Steele County, Minnesota,
on December 21, 1874, and moved to
North Dakota in 1881. He graduated from the
University of North Dakota in 1901 and returned
to the family farm in Pembina County.

In 1916 the newly organized Nonpartisan
League recruited Frazier, who had never run
for public office, to run for governor of North
Dakota. Frazier was elected in a landslide.
He was reelected in 1918 and 1920. During his
administration, League reforms that were enacted
included a state-owned grain elevator,
state-owned bank, and Industrial Commission.
In 1921 opponents of Frazier's reform
program forced a recall election. Frazier
was defeated by Ragnvold Nestos, becoming
the first American governor to be recalled
from office. In 1922, however, Frazier was recruited
to run for the U.S. Senate and was
easily elected.

As a senator, Frazier aligned himself with
the progressive Republican bloc led by Robert
La Follette and George Norris. Frazier and his
fellow progressives supported agrarian and
other social reforms, organized labor, and
public power. He was reelected in 1928 and
1934. By the late 1920s Frazier had turned
much of his attention to world affairs. An isolationist
and pacifist, Frazier supported efforts
by the Women's Peace Union to ban war and
introduced a constitutional amendment outlawing
warfare. He also supported national
referenda to determine whether the United
States would become involved in foreign wars.
In 1940 Frazier ran for a fourth term but lost
the Republican primary to William Langer.
He retired to his farm and died on January 11,
1947.
