KANSAS-NEBRASKA ACT

The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 brought territorial
government to that portion of the
Louisiana Purchase between the Missouri
River and the divide of the Rocky Mountains
and from 37º north latitude to the boundary
of British America at 49º north latitude. The
act created, within this huge area, the territories
of Kansas and Nebraska, dividing them at
40º north latitude. In addition to what became
the states of Kansas (1861) and Nebraska
(1867), portions of what became Colorado
were included in the Kansas and Nebraska
Territories and parts of what became Wyoming,
South Dakota, North Dakota, and
Montana were within Nebraska Territory.

The Kansas-Nebraska Act would be crucial
in the coming of the Civil War. The Missouri
Compromise (1820) had banned slavery in the
Louisiana Purchase north of 36º30' north latitude,
except within the borders of the slave
state of Missouri that was created by the Compromise.
By midcentury there was growing
pressure to open the trans-Missouri Indian
country to settlement. The Platte Purchase, a
3,139-square-mile area adjoining the Missouri
River north and northwest of modern Kansas
City, had been carved, with no sectional commotion,
from the nonslave area of the Louisiana
Purchase and added to Missouri in 1837.
In 1846 Iowa entered the Union, extending
that state to the Missouri River. Two years earlier
Rep. Stephen Douglas of Illinois had offered
the first bill to provide territorial government
for the trans-Missouri area, called
"Nebraska." A Nebraska bill passed the House
in 1853 but failed in the Senate, largely because
of southern opposition.

In December 1853 Sen. Augustus Dodge of
Iowa offered a Nebraska bill that, like the recent
House measure, did not address the slavery
issue. Stephen Douglas, who chaired the
Senate Committee on Territories, recognized
that southern opposition to the Missouri
Compromise ban upon slavery threatened
such legislation. In January 1854 he reported a
rewritten bill that embodied the "popular sovereignty"
principle, by which the people of the
territory ultimately would decide if their prospective
state would or would not have slavery.
This concept had been basic to his legislation
to organize New Mexico and Utah Territories,
key parts of the Compromise of 1850. However,
southern pressure for explicit repeal of
the 36º30' line was soon evident, and Douglas
brought in a bill by adding such a repeal. This
revision also called for the establishment of
two territories. The latter provision implicitly
recognized that frontier Iowa and Missouri
boosters had produced separate nuclei of potential
settlement in the trans-Missouri country
and that diverse transcontinental railroad
interests would be served by the creation of
two territories, Kansas and Nebraska. Despite
northern outrage over the proposed repeal of
the Missouri Compromise slavery ban, the
Kansas-Nebraska bill passed Congress, and on
May 30, 1854, received President Franklin
Pierce's signature.

As historian James Malin explained, Douglas
saw the Great Lakes–Mississippi Valley region
as the "geographical pivot" for continental
development. To Douglas, popular
sovereignty was a rational policy that would
facilitate the nation's spatial and economic development.
But this was not a calm, deliberative
time, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act
brought two tremendous forces—the slavery
controversy and national expansion augmented
by technology—into collision. The ensuing
agitation, including the conflict called
"Bleeding Kansas," brought a recasting of political
parties that destabilized the Republic
and propelled the nation toward war.
