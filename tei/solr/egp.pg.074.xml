SIFTON, CLIFFORD (1861-1929)

Sir Clifford Sifton was a successful Manitoba
lawyer, entrepreneur, member of the provincial
and federal governments, and newspaper
publisher. Of Protestant Irish descent, Sifton
was born near Arva, Ontario, on March 10,
1861, educated there and in Manitoba, and
trained as a lawyer in Winnipeg. He settled in
Brandon in 1882, where he established a law
practice and speculated in land during the
early settlement years of the region. Elected to
the provincial legislature in 1888, he became
attorney general in the Liberal government of
Thomas Greenway in 1891. He led a successful
defense of the government's controversial
1890 legislation to create a system of national
schools, and his efforts stimulated expansion
of the province's railway network.

In November of 1896 he became minister of
the interior and superintendent-general of Indian
Affairs in the federal Liberal government
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. There he devoted his
great energies and organizational abilities to
attracting settlers to the Prairie West. Through
aggressive advertising in the United States,
Great Britain, and Europe, he brought the potential
of the Canadian Prairies to the attention
of vast numbers of potential immigrants.
He overhauled the system for getting immigrants
to the West and actually settled on the
land, and he pressured railway and other interests
to make available vast tracts of land
previously withheld from settlement. His policy
of attracting large numbers of settlers from
central and eastern Europe, particularly Slavs
such as Poles, Ukrainians, and Doukhobors,
was intensely controversial; nativist critics believed
that the newcomers, who often settled
in blocs, would fail to assimilate and would
undermine the essential British character of
Canadian society. Though unmoved by this
argument, Sifton had his own prejudices, believing
that these people were peasant races
who would succeed in coping with the hardships
of Prairie farming where thousands of
Britishers had failed. As he later famously remarked,
"I think a stalwart peasant in a sheepskin
coat, born on the soil, whose forefathers
have been farmers for ten generations, with a
stout wife and a half-dozen children, is good
quality."

Sifton also was responsible for government
policy in the Yukon during the gold rush beginning
in 1897, and he was Canada's agentgeneral
during the Alaska Boundary Tribunal
of 1903. He was chiefly responsible for negotiating
lowered freight rates into and out of the
West in connection with the building of the
Crowsnest Pass Railway in 1897 and was influential
in shaping the government's railway legislation
in 1903. In 1905, when the government
was about to create the new Provinces of Alberta
and Saskatchewan, Sifton disagreed with
Laurier over the educational provisions of the
proposed provincial acts and resigned from
the cabinet. He remained in Parliament as a
private member until 1911, when he opposed
the government's policy with respect to reciprocity
with the United States. He played a
significant role in helping the Conservative opposition
defeat Laurier's government. His last
major involvement in politics came in 1917,
when during World War I he actively aided in
the organization and successful election campaign
of a win-the-war Union government,
dedicated to implementing a policy of conscription.
Sifton was knighted in 1915.

In 1909 Laurier appointed Sifton to head
the Canadian Commission of Conservation, a
position he held until November 1918. The
commission was influential in promoting the
efficient management of resources. In 1897-98
he had purchased the Manitoba Free Press of
Winnipeg to be the major organ of the Liberal
Party in western Canada; it was an enormously
profitable investment, both politically
and financially, owing much to Sifton's selection
of the brilliant John W. Dafoe as editor.
At his death, in New York City on April 17,
1929, the paper was the most valuable item in
the family's considerable portfolio. Sifton had
become a figure of national importance, but
his reputation rests most securely in his role in
developing the Prairie West.
