SILVER REPUBLICANS

Committed to unlimited silver coinage ("free
silver"), Silver Republicans opposed the restrictive
financial policies of the national Republican
Party in the late nineteenth century.
They predominated in the West, especially in
the Rocky Mountain states, whose silver production
would benefit from a larger federal
market, and in the Plains states, where troubled
farmers favored inflation to reduce their
debt burden and to increase farm prices.

From the 1870s on, silverites succeeded in
including free silver in Republican state platforms,
and they steadily supported silver proposals
in Congress. In 1889–90 the "omnibus"
admission of six new western states, including
North and South Dakota, increased their congressional
influence, and they secured passage
of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act.

After eastern Republicans joined conservative
Democrats under President Grover Cleveland
to repeal the Sherman Act in 1893, the
silver issue quickly rose to dominate politics
and contribute to the realignment of the
1890s. Led by Sen. Henry Teller of Colorado
and Sen. Richard Pettigrew of South Dakota,
Silver Republicans joined Democrats and
Populists in agitating the issue.

When the 1896 Republican platform adopted
the gold standard, many Silver Republicans reluctantly
acquiesced, but others bolted to organize
the Silver Republican Party. It proposed
Teller as a candidate acceptable to all silverites
but endorsed the subsequent Democratic nomination
of William Jennings Bryan on a silver
platform. Although the Bryan campaign failed,
Silver Republicans had success in state elections
in Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota, where
they fused with Democrats and Populists.

Thereafter, some Silver Republicans rejoined
the main party; others continued to
fuse with Populists and Democrats but with
diminishing success. After Bryan's second defeat
in 1900, they dissolved their organization
and followed Pettigrew into the Democratic
Party.
