COMFORT, E. NICHOLAS (1884-1956)

The Reverend E. Nicholas Comfort, founder of
the Oklahoma School of Religion, was a leading
southwestern proponent of the Social Gospel.
He was born in Brookston, Texas, on May
1, 1884. Overcoming an impoverished youth in
eastern Texas and western Oklahoma, Comfort
was educated at McCormick Theological
Seminary, the University of Chicago, Columbia
University, and Union Theological Seminary.
In 1924 he returned to Oklahoma to become
pastor for Presbyterian students at the
state's flagship university in Norman.

Determined to overcome sectarianism and
fundamentalism, Comfort established the Oklahoma School of Religion in 1927. During the
two decades of its existence, the School of Religion
(1927-48) strove to provide interdenominational
instruction. In the process, the
school, along with Dean Comfort as its director,
proved enormously controversial. Comfort
propounded the message of the fatherhood
of God and the brotherhood of man,
while condemning militarism, racism, and
economic inequities. As a consequence, both
he and the School of Religion experienced ridicule
from less ecumenically inclined ministers,
self-proclaimed patriots, and right-wing
politicians. Investigative committees examined
the operations of Comfort and his school,
initially resulting in a firestorm of protest from
supporters across the state. The emergence of
the cold war resulted in an even less hospitable
climate, and the School of Religion was forced
to close its doors in 1948. By that point, Comfort
was preaching as an itinerant minister and
building a new, small house on the outskirts of
Norman. After suffering two strokes, Comfort
and his wife, Esther, moved to Rochester, Minnesota,
to be close to one of their three children
and the Mayo Clinic. He died there on
February 27, 1956.
