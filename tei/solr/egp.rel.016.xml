DISPENSATIONALISM

Among evangelical Christian churches in the
Great Plains, dispensationalism is an influential
hermeneutical system or framework intended
to make sense of the vast and varied
literature of the Bible. The system assumes the
existence of a personal God who created the
world and humankind; a historical, grammatical
interpretation of the Bible (which describes
both God's work and providential plan for human
history); and a premillennial understanding
of eschatology. Although the number of
"dispensations," or historical periods, is sometimes
thought to be the distinctive feature of
dispensationalism, other hermeneutical systems
(such as covenant theology) also describe
biblical history in terms of such phases. The
major periods include the patriarchal, Mosaic,
church, millennial kingdom, and eternal kingdom.
Dispensationalism relates these to one
another as distinct outworkings of God's purposes.
For example, God's purposes during
the Mosaic dispensation are different from
his purposes during the dispensation of the
church. Likewise, the relevant entities are distinct:
during the Mosaic dispensation people
related to God through the nation of Israel and
the covenants that God made with that nation.
Following the death of Jesus Christ, however,
God instituted a new entity, the church, as the
vehicle through which he would accomplish
his purposes for the present dispensation.

Churches in the Plains that are best known
for their dispensational approach to the Bible
include the Berean Fellowship of Churches
(centered in Nebraska), Independent Fundamental
Churches of America (Kansas and Colorado),
General Association of Regular Baptist
Churches (Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Montana),
Baptist Bible Fellowship (centered in
Missouri), and World Baptist Fellowship
(strongest in Texas). There has also been some
dispensational influence in the mainline denominations,
though it is not extensive. W. A.
Criswell has been the best-known dispensationalist
in Southern Baptist circles; Lewis
Sperry Chafer and John F. Walvoord (both
associated with Dallas Theological Seminary)
were Presbyterian. The American Sunday
School Union has also been influential in beginning
Sunday schools in the Dakotas, Nebraska,
and Colorado. The Rural Home Missionary
Association, headquartered in Illinois,
is active in ministry in the Plains states.

Dispensational Bible colleges and institutes
that are located in the Great Plains include the
Rocky Mountain Bible Institute in Denver
(now part of Colorado Christian University),
Midwest Bible and Missionary Institute (Salina,
Kansas, now part of Calvary Bible College
and Seminary in Kansas City), Prairie
Bible Institute (Three Hills, Alberta), Montana
Bible Institute (Lewiston, Montana), and
Frontier School of the Bible (LaGrange, Wyoming).
The most significant dispensational influences
on churches of the Great Plains have
been Dallas Theological Seminary and Moody
Bible Institute (Chicago), which have trained
many of the pastors and teachers for ministry
in these institutions.

The two best-known popularizers of dispensationalism
in the Plains have been C. I.
Scofield and William Aberhart. Scofield was
an attorney and politician from Kansas who,
after ordination to the Congregational ministry
in 1882, edited the dispensational Scofield
Reference Bible. Aberhart was a Baptist radio
preacher in Calgary who founded the Calgary
Prophetic Bible Institute and headed Alberta's
Social Credit government from 1935 until his
death in 1943.
