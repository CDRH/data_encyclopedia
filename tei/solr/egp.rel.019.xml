EASTERN ORTHODOX


Saint Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Gardenton, Manitoba built in 1935


Divided administratively into fifteen autocephalous
(independent) territorial churches,
Orthodox Christians claim to be the one holy
Catholic and Apostolic Church founded by
Christ. They hold to the "orthodox" (right-believing)
canons, faith, and doctrines as defined
by the seven ecumenical councils convoked
in the Byzantine Empire from 325 to 787
A.D. Characterized by their sacramental theology,
hierarchical ecclesiology, iconodulism,
and rich liturgical tradition, Orthodox Christians
number approximately 250 million people and live primarily in Russia, eastern Europe,
the Balkans, and the Middle East. There
are about four million Orthodox Christians in
North America.

The Russian Orthodox Church established
the first Orthodox mission in North American
in 1794 and opened a missionary diocese
in San Francisco in 1872. Over the next thirty
years this diocese welcomed hundreds of
thousands of Orthodox immigrants from the
Balkans, and more widely from the Ottoman,
Russian, and Austro-Hungarian Empires.
Greeks, Slavs (Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusans,
Macedonians, Montenegrins, Bulgarians),
Romanians, and Arabs comprised the
bulk of these Orthodox immigrants.

In Canada most Orthodox immigrants became
homesteaders in the Great Plains. Between
1890 and 1914, thanks in part to a government
policy that encouraged settlement in
the western provinces, a quarter of a million
Romanians and Ukrainians from Bukovina,
Moldova, Galicia, and Banat moved to the Canadian
Prairies. Ukrainians formed the first
Orthodox parish in the Canadian Plains in
1898; four years later the first Romanian parish
opened in Regina. From these small beginnings,
the number of Canadian Orthodox
Christians has grown to 750,000.

In the United States, by contrast, most Orthodox
immigrants stayed in large cities in
New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, where
they worked in mines, factories, and shops.
But by the 1890s increasing numbers of Orthodox
workers were moving to the Great
Plains and taking jobs in rail transport, meatpacking
plants, steel mills, and mines. Slavic
workers at the Globe smelting plant north of
Denver founded the Holy Transfiguration
Church in 1898; in 1903 and 1905, respectively,
Slavic steelworkers in the Plains towns of
Pueblo and Calhan, Colorado, opened their
own parishes.

After 1905 Greeks replaced Slavs as the largest
Orthodox ethnic group. Between 1890 and
1920 some 600,000 Greeks arrived in the
United States and founded more than 140 parishes.
Job opportunities attracted some of
these Greeks to the Great Plains. In 1904, for
example, a meatpacking strike in Omaha, Nebraska,
led manufacturers there to seek out
cheaper Greek workers. In 1908 they founded
an Orthodox parish, Saint John the Baptist,
that survived a vicious anti-Greek pogrom a
year later. Between 1906 and 1909 Greeks also
founded churches in Denver, Pueblo, and
Kansas City.

Smaller ethnic groups also formed Orthodox
parishes in the U.S. Plains. In 1902 Lebanese
Arabs founded the parish of Saint George
in the cattle town of Kearney, Nebraska; sixteen
years later Christian Arabs opened a
church in Wichita, Kansas. Between 1904 and
1920 Romanians created thirteen parishes in
the Midwest.

After the Russian Revolution, the Orthodox
community split along ethnic and political
lines. By 1930 Greeks, Ukrainians, Romanians,
Arabs, Serbs, Bulgarians, and Albanians had
established jurisdictions that were wholly independent
of the original Russian Orthodox
missionary diocese. Disputes over liturgical
questions and the church's proper relationship
to the Communist government exacerbated
these ethnic splits; today there are more
than thirty Orthodox jurisdictions in North
America.

A minority of the four million American and
Canadian Orthodox Christians lives in the
Great Plains today, but various Orthodox jurisdictions
are working to increase that number.
The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada
(UOCC) has 128,000 adherents in 290 parishes,
most of which are located in the Prairie Provinces.
The uocc also operates Saint Andrew's
College in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Sixty of the
600 parishes of the Orthodox Church of America
(the name that the original Russian missionary
diocese adopted in 1970) are in the
Great Plains. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese
of America opened its Denver bishopric for the
Great Plains in 1979 and is currently completing
construction of a new diocesan center there.
The Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese
of North America, which is subordinate
to the patriarch of Antioch in Syria, has
moved beyond its Arab ethnic base by encouraging
a "Western rite" similar to the Anglican
prayer book of 1928. Several old, conservative
Episcopalian churches have converted to Antiochian
Orthodoxy; for example, in 1991 the
archdiocese received Saint Marks of Denver,
originally founded as an Anglican church in
1895. Although only 20 of its 159 parishes are
located in the Great Plains, the Antiochian
Archdiocese in 1995 consecrated a chancery,
overseen by auxiliary Bishop Basil (Essey), in
Wichita, Kansas.
