EPP, THEODORE (1907-1985)

Theodore Epp was the founder of the international
radio broadcast Back to the Bible.
Born in Oraibi, Arizona, on January 27, 1907,
the son of missionaries to the Hopi Indians,
after seminary he pastored several churches in
Oklahoma. In November 1934, however, Epp
was invited to preach a message on a local
radio station and this event changed his life.

On May 1, 1939, Theodore Epp drove to
Lincoln, Nebraska, to begin his radio ministry.
He had $95 in his pocket, enough to pay
for three weeks of airtime on kfor, at that
time a 250-watt station. Less than a year later,
the popularity of Epp's Bible teaching created
an opportunity to release the program on a
much larger station in Grand Island, Nebraska,
where he moved. But Theodore Epp
soon knew that Lincoln was to be the home
of his ministry, and in 1942 his family and
he returned to the capital city and began airing
Back to the Bible on KFAB, a 10,000-watt
station.

From these humble beginnings, the influence
of Epp's radio broadcast rapidly grew.
Today, Back to the Bible is heard on more than
900 radio stations, translators, and cable outlets
every day. The ministry broadcasts in Chinese,
Russian, Spanish, Italian, and twenty-five
other languages from ten international offices.
Theodore Epp's dream of teaching the Bible on
radio has been expanded to include four different
daily radio broadcasts, television, video,
print, and the Internet. Theodore Epp died on
October 13, 1985.
