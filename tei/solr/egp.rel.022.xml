EVANGELICALISM

Evangelicalism is a Protestant ethos that has
fostered denominational, interdenominational,
and nondenominational traditions and
institutions since its emergence in the late seventeenth
and the eighteenth centuries. As an
ethos, evangelicalism has been a phenomenon
of religious contention as well as revitalization.
It encompasses denominations as diverse
as the Assemblies of God, the Churches of
Christ, the Conservative Baptist Association,
and the Evangelical Free Church, yet evangelicalism
has had, and continues to have,
an influence on many members and groups
within other denominations, from the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America to the Reformed
Church in America, and on unnumbered
independent congregations and other
religious organizations.

Confusion about the nature and development
of evangelicalism is in part due to popular
conflation of the historical ethos with
evangel and evangelism. "Evangel" is a rough
transliteration of the New Testament Greek
word for good news or gospel. While evangelicalism
has certainly been concerned with
the evangel of Jesus Christ, it has never had
exclusive possession of it. Similarly, while
evangelism–the intentional propagation of
the Christian good news–has also been a central
concern in evangelicalism, evangelicals
have not been the only Christians to encourage
and engage in evangelism.

To the conceptual ambiguity in evangelicalism's
name, the historical development of the
ethos adds further complexity. As a term,
"evangelical" arose in connection with the
Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century.
In distinction from Roman Catholicism,
Protestants at the time saw themselves as
stressing the gospel of justification by faith in
the atoning work of God in Jesus Christ. The
formative century for evangelicalism, though,
was the eighteenth. The convergence of elements
of English Puritanism with the newer
movement of continental pietism fed a burgeoning
network of personal contacts and institutional
ties epitomized by the evangelical
Anglicans George Whitefield and John Wesley
and the Moravian Count Zinzendorf. Itinerant
preaching for conversion, publishing religious
literature for evangelism and growth in
holiness, and founding societies and institutions
that downplayed denominational distinctions
in the interests of promoting the
gospel marked a broad European–North
American "evangelical awakening" that encompassed
varied local episodes of revivalism
and evangelical institution-building.

By the time of European American settlement
in the Great Plains in the mid– to late
nineteenth century, "evangelical" was a term the
majority of North American Protestants would
have accepted as an apt one for themselves and
their coreligionists. Particularly among Anglo-American
Protestants, whether Baptists, Congregationalists,
Methodists, or Presbyterians,
evangelicalism had become an ethos that
stressed transdenominational emphases on
personalizing belief in the atoning work of
Christ, on the centrality of using the Bible for
faith and practice, and on the importance of
faith-based activism. In other words, by 1900
the evangelical ethos was conversionist, crucicentric,
biblicist, activist, and populist. Late-nineteenth-
and early-twentieth-century Protestant
evangelists who worked in the Great
Plains, whether lesser-known local or denominational
figures, or more famous national, interdenominational
figures such as Dwight L.
Moody, John Wilbur Chapman, and William
A. "Billy" Sunday, were evangelicals. So,
too, were most nineteenth-century Englishspeaking
Protestant home missionaries, circuit
riders, and missionaries to Native Americans.
Also, many Protestants who sought to act on
the social implications of the gospel in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth century were
evangelicals.

However, by 1900 the evangelical dominance
of North American Protestantism was also
showing signs of fraying. Larger social and intellectual
trends were leading some elements
among otherwise evangelical Protestant groups
and institutions to respond by downplaying supernaturalism
in favor of divine immanence
and by challenging conventional understandings
of the Bible's composition, meaning, and
authority. Other Protestants accentuated or developed
various aspects of the evangelical ethos
to counter perceived "modernizing" trends
within and outside of the religious community.
Dispensationalism, the holiness movement, and
pentecostalism arose as distinct movements
within evangelicalism that were well represented
in the U.S. Great Plains. These movements
not only led in many cases to new institutions
(e.g., Bible institutes and colleges, the
Church of the Nazarene, and the Assemblies of
God) but also fed a more militant antimodernist
and separatist stream within evangelicalism.

During the same turn-of-the-century era, a
Christian restorationist tradition that had always
been a minority element within evangelicalism
became more institutionally distinct
when the Churches of Christ distinguished
themselves from the Disciples of Christ in 1906.
Symbolic of the strength of the Churches of
Christ in Oklahoma and Texas is Abilene Christian
University, an important Great Plains religious
and educational institution within an
anti-institutional evangelical tradition.

After 1920 the more militant antimodernists
within evangelicalism were calling themselves
fundamentalists. As fundamentalism
became the then-newest movement to take
shape under the umbrella of the evangelical
ethos, evangelicalism in all its burgeoning
complexity not only persisted in the U.S.
Great Plains through churches, revivalism, periodicals,
camps, educational institutions, radio,
and later television and film, but it also
took root and flourished in the Prairies of
Canada. In 1922 Kansan Leslie E. Maxwell arrived
in Three Hills, Alberta, and founded the
nondenominational Prairie Bible Institute. It
is perhaps the most famous of several Canadian
Plains evangelical institutions of higher
education founded or reorganized since 1920,
including the Canadian Bible Institute and
Canadian Theological Seminary in Regina,
Saskatchewan (Christian and Missionary Alliance),
the Canadian Mennonite Bible College,
the Canadian Nazarene College, and
Catherine Booth College (Salvation Army), all
in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the King's University
College in Edmonton, Alberta (Christian
Reformed).

In the Great Plains since World War II, evangelicalism
has grown in numbers and in its
public presence even as the intermingling of
its various elements has made for some new
forms of old elements. The rise of Oral Roberts
illustrates some of the contemporary flexibility
of evangelicalism in the Great Plains. Roberts
began his adult career before and during the
war as a pastor and evangelist for the Pentecostal
Holiness Church. Not long after the war,
though, the native Oklahoman launched an
independent evangelistic and healing ministry
that came to be institutionalized in television
broadcasts and Oral Roberts University and its
associated organizations in Tulsa. Further, in
1968 Roberts reflected a resurgence of a more
open rather than separatist evangelicalism
when he publicly left the Pentecostal Holiness
Church and took ministerial ordination in the
United Methodist Church. He also embodies
both the strength and weaknesses of another
aspect of contemporary evangelicalism: religious
fiefdoms built around the charisma of
an individual.

While the future vitality of Roberts's religious
empire seems in question, another new
center of evangelicalism in the Great Plains–Colorado
Springs, Colorado–continues to
thrive in the twenty-first century. Colorado
Springs's electronics firms and military have
been joined by a plethora of evangelical institutions,
which were either founded or relocated
there since 1945. Evangelical groups such
as the Navigators, the Christian Booksellers
Association, Young Life, and Focus on the
Family employed in 1991 some 2,000 people
and pumped some $40 million in payroll into
the local economy. Moreover, by 1995 local estimates
put the self-designated proportion of
evangelicals in the city of 300,000 at 40 percent.
Particular leaders and institutions and
movements embodying the evangelical ethos
will continue to come and go, but evangelicalism
at large has become a permanent part of
Great Plains life.
