HUBBARD, L. RON (1911-1986)

L. Ron Hubbard developed the spiritual healing
technology known as dianetics and the applied
religious philosophy of scientology.
While some details of Hubbard's life are disputed
in scholarly studies of scientology, Hubbard's
public achievements are remarkable by
any standard of measurement.

Hubbard was born on March 13, 1911, in
Tilden, Nebraska, the son of Harry Ross Hubbard,
an officer in the U.S. Navy, and Ledora
May Waterbury de Wolfe. He traveled the
world during his teen years and published a
number of adventure stories. By the 1940s he
had established himself as one of the most
prolific science fiction writers in the world.

Hubbard's career took a dramatic turn during
a tour of duty in the U.S. Navy during
World War II, when he became interested in
discovering the cause of physical and emotional
problems. His studies led him to conclude
that ideally the mind has control over
the body. He developed a new form of psychotherapy,
which was spelled out in Dianetics:
The Modern Science of Mental Health, a perennial
best-seller since its publication in 1950.
The goal of dianetic therapy was to clear the
mind of painful memory blocks called "engrams,"
which limited the mind's control of
the body. Unlike similar-sounding therapies,
dianetics claims that these engramatic memories
extend to the prenatal period and must be
cleared in chronological sequence, beginning
with the earliest painful experiences. When
the mind is cleared, the person becomes totally
self-determined.

Hubbard's experience with dianetic therapy
led to the astonishing discovery that his clients
were troubled by engrams from previous lives.
Hubbard believed that this finding proved
conclusively that humans are spiritual beings
who inhabit a body and use a mind but are
identical with neither. On the basis of this discovery,
Hubbard developed the religious philosophy
that he called "scientology," a system
of spiritual counseling and training to liberate
the immortal and omniscient self from all dependence
on matter, energy, space, and time.

The first Church of Scientology was established
in 1954 to deliver these spiritual services
in the precise ways prescribed by Hubbard.
Under his personal supervision, a worldwide
network of scientology churches was established.
During this time, he wrote numerous
books and hundreds of papers standardizing
the teachings and practices of scientology.
Hubbard resigned his position as executive director
of the Church of Scientology in 1967 to
research higher levels of spiritual attainment
and to develop community development programs
in literacy, drug rehabilitation, and administrative
techniques.

Hubbard died in Creston, California, on
January 24, 1986. He left a legacy of fiction and
nonfiction works that have been translated
into thirty-three languages, with more than
120 million copies in circulation. His nonfiction
works serve as the sacred scripture for a
worldwide religious movement, whose more
than 3,000 churches and missions minister to
some eight million people in more than 100
countries and thirty languages. Hubbard is
neither idolized nor worshiped by his followers.
Rather, he is honored as the founder of
a contemporary religion that combines the
spirituality of Eastern religions and the rationality
of Western science.
