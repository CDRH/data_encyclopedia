HUTTERIES

The Hutterian Brethren (commonly known as
the Hutterites) are a traditional Christian sect
who settled in many agricultural colonies
across the Great Plains of the United States
and Canada. Approximately 36,000 members
live and work communally in about 428 collective
farms, or Bruderhofs (Bruderhöfe).

The Hutterian movement began in 1528,
when an Anabaptist sect in Austerlitz, Moravia
(now the Czech Republic), adopted communal
living, rejected the sanctioned practice
of infant baptism, and renounced the Catholic
doctrine of transubstantiation. Severely persecuted
for these heresies, the sect found its
current name in 1536 when an early leader,
Jakob Hutter, was burned at the stake.

After more than 300 years of persecution
and forced migration within eastern Europe
and Russia, the Hutterites fled to Dakota Territory
between 1874 and 1877. However, they
were again persecuted in the United States
during World War I due to their strict pacifism
and Germanic ethnicity, and all but one
colony migrated to Canada in 1918. While
many colonies remain in Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Manitoba, and British Columbia today,
others have returned to, or have been founded
in, the United States. These are primarily located
in South Dakota and Montana but are
also found in North Dakota, Minnesota, and
Washington.

Daily life in Hutterian colonies revolves
around religion, as Hutterites attend services
every evening and twice on Sunday. Their spiritual
beliefs discourage selfish interests and
emphasize serving the communal good. The
tenet of Gelassenheit–or "self-surrender"–entails
a rejection of material luxury and personal
wealth. Modeling themselves after the
early Christians (see Acts 2:44–47), the Hutterites
practice communal ownership of land
and other goods. While individual families live
in private apartments, each colony holds all
possessions and money in a common trust.
Hutterites eat and work collectively, receiving
no individual salary but sharing equally in the
proceeds of their labor. The colony provides
for all basic necessities, such as medical costs,
child care, clothing, and furniture.

Hutterian colonies are located in sparsely
populated areas to minimize interaction with
the outside world and thus focus attention on
spiritual goals. Like the well-known Amish
and Mennonites (who are not communal),
the Hutterites adhere to traditional dress, customs,
and language. Unlike these other Germanic
Anabaptist sects, the Hutterites employ
modern technology and methods of agriculture
and manufacturing.

Hutterites learn English but use High German
in religious services and informally speak
a Tyrolean dialect, which they call Hutterisch.
Children learn Hutterite traditions and history
in a German-speaking classroom while also
studying standard academic topics in a government-mandated
school, which they call the
"English" school. They are growing more open
to conventional education, and some Hutterite
teenagers now earn high school diplomas.

Adolescents become adult members at age
fifteen and are eligible for baptism at age
twenty. At this age, a Hutterite woman generally
leaves her colony to marry a man in another
colony, which receives a dowry in exchange.
The Hutterites practice traditional
gender roles, and women cannot vote or hold
colony office. Large families are encouraged,
and Hutterites have some of the highest birthrates
of any ethnic or religious group in the
United States, with an average of nine children
per family. For this reason, the total number
of Hutterites and Hutterian colonies rises
steadily. When a colony grows too large (130.
150 members), it splits and forms a "daughter"
colony.

Some related traditional sects, such as the
Bruderhof of New York, Pennsylvania, and
Connecticut, or nonagricultural colonies in
Japan, England, and Paraguay, have grown out
of the Hutterian movement. The Prarieleut
are people of Hutterian descent who also settled
in the Great Plains but do not live communally,
and they often attend Mennonite
churches.
