MENNONITES

Mennonites are a Christian sect that originated
in southern Germany, Switzerland, and
the Netherlands in the sixteenth century. They
have lived in the Great Plains since the 1870s,
when thousands emigrated there at the encouragement
of state officials and railroad
companies who desired to settle the region.
Entire Mennonite villages often migrated en
masse from Europe to the Great Plains to flee
religious persecution. These mass migrations
helped Mennonites create several distinctive
population hearths in this region. Today, from
a worldwide membership of slightly over one
million, approximately 10 percent reside in
the Great Plains.

Manitoba became a principal Canadian settlement
site because of the East and West Reserve
lands, established south of Winnipeg by
Canadian officials in 1873 and 1876, respectively,
which offered settlers the autonomy
they sought. There, Mennonites built their
own schools and replicated the economic and
social patterns practiced in Europe. In the
mid.twentieth century a majority of Mennonites
in the Prairie Provinces lived on farms,
but this percentage has declined dramatically
in recent decades. Today, Winnipeg has the
largest concentration of Mennonites of any urban
center in the region.

In the United States, Mennonite immigrants
found land and a climate that encouraged
settlement around Henderson, Nebraska,
in 1874, and near Freeman, South
Dakota, in 1873. In Kansas, the area near Newton
became a major cultural hearth starting
around 1874, largely through the construction
of liberal arts colleges, hospitals, and relief
agencies. In south-central Kansas, land shortages
following World War II and economic
pressures forced Mennonites off farms and
into communities, where they quickly built
institutions and businesses that reflected their
Mennonite ideology. For example, Mennonite
entrepreneur Lyle Yost founded Hesston Corporation
(today known as Hay and Forage,
Incorporated), a leading agricultural machinery
manufacturer.

The multiplicity of Mennonite origins in
Europe means that the Mennonites of the
Great Plains are by no means a homogeneous
group, having brought with them differing
traditions and emphases in their faith. The
various Mennonite strains do, however, have
many practices in common, including adult
baptism, separation from the larger culture,
simple living, and pacifism. Traditionally,
pacifism has meant not complying with conscription
(conscientious objection) and not
supporting militarism. This pacifistic stance
has often put them at odds with the state and
non-Mennonites in general, both in Europe
and in North America. Today, support for
community-based nonviolent campaigns and
conflict mediation agencies have become the
primary outlet for these pacifist beliefs. Battles
with the state over conscription are increasingly
rare. In fact, because of the publicized
efforts of the Mennonite relief agencies, such
as Mennonite Central Committee, service,
rather than strident pacifism, became the
group's defining trait in the latter half of the
twentieth century.

Initially, the Great Plains appealed to Mennonites
because of the group's traditional
rural bias, derived from centuries of persecution
in Europe. Certainly Mennonitism in the
Great Plains once was very parochial, as they
were a reserved people, speaking Germanic
dialects, wearing distinctive, simple garb, and
living in isolated rural enclaves. Most Mennonites
believed that their faith was incompatible
with urban life. Although Mennonites
are still widely perceived as a rural people,
more frequently Mennonites are making their
homes in Plains towns, living and working
alongside non-Mennonites. Distinctive dress,
language, and physical isolation have given
way to service work and conflict resolution as
the defining elements of Mennonitism today.
