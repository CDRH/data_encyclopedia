 Roman Catholicism 


Mexican Catholic Church, Deming, New Mexico, 1910–1919


Roman Catholicism was the first European
church to be introduced into the Great Plains,
and it remains the single largest denomination
in the region. This reflects the diversity of
Protestant denominations, of course, as well
as the continued importance of Catholicism.
But Catholicism in the Plains, as elsewhere in
North America, is by no means homogeneous.
At least through the middle of the
twentieth century, it was an ethnically diverse
church, and the various cultures of Catholicism
in the region have much to do with the
history of immigration.

As early as 1680, Spanish Franciscan missions
lined the valley of the upper Rio Grande
and spilled out onto the Great Plains to the east
of Santa Fe. The number of these missions was
reduced over the course of the following century,
but Spaniards intermarried with Native
Americans, and the religious legacy, reinforced
by subsequent waves of Latino migrations in
the 1920s, 1950s, and in recent decades, has
persisted. In 1990, in almost all of the Plains
counties of New Mexico and Colorado, Roman
Catholicism is the largest denomination.

Spaniards, and Catholicism, did not extend
significantly into the Southern Great Plains
from the Franciscan missions that were established
on the Gulf Coast Plain of Texas in
the eighteenth century–the Comanches and
Apaches formed a formidable barrier. Witness
the destruction of Mission Santa Cruz de San
Sabá (built in 1757 at a site near present-day
Menard, Texas) by a force of 2,000 Comanches
and other Indians on March 16, 1758,
which left two of the three Franciscan missionaries
dead.

The next nucleus of Catholicism in the
Great Plains emerged in the Red River Valley of
the North in the early nineteenth century. In
1818 Lord Selkirk (Thomas Douglas) requested
Catholic missionaries to serve his nascent
colony of Scots, Irish, and Métis settlers. One
of their number, Joseph-Norbert Provencher,
was appointed bishop and apostolic vicar of
the Northwest in 1820, and he later became
the first bishop of St. Boniface. Alexandre-Antonin
Taché, of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate,
followed Provencher to the Red River
Settlement in 1845. Working as an assistant to
Provencher, Taché was a tireless missionary to
the Indians, Métis, and new settlers in the interior.
He was appointed bishop of St. Boniface
in 1853 and archbishop in 1871. Catholicism in
the Prairie Provinces grew through conversion
and in-migration of French Canadians and,
later, eastern and southern Europeans. Roman
Catholics remain the most numerous religious
group in the Prairie Provinces, except for a belt
of counties in southern Alberta, Saskatchewan,
and Manitoba, where the United Church
of Canada predominates. Lac St. Anne, situated
forty miles to the west of Edmonton, is
the most important Catholic pilgrimage site in
western Canada.

Roman Catholic missionaries were also active
to the south of the forty-ninth parallel.
The peripatetic Jesuit missionary Pierre-Jean
De Smet began his work at the Saint Joseph's
Mission to the Potawatomis at Council Bluffs
in 1838, and he baptized thousands of Indians
and Metis in the Northern Plains over the
course of the next thirty years. In the Southern
Plains, in present-day Kansas, Catholic missions
were established for the Potawatomis
(1838), Miamis (1847), and Osages (1847).

The ranks of Catholics in the Plains were
greatly increased by immigrants after 1854—first
Irish and Germans, then Germans from
Russia, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians
and others from eastern Europe, Italians, and
most recently, Latinos. In North Dakota, Germans
from Russia, clustering in the southcentral
counties, were the most numerous
Catholics. Germans from Russia also settled in
Ellis County, in west-central Kansas, while
Catholics from the Rhineland, Alsace, and
Westphalia settled to the northwest of Wichita.
Such clustering was encouraged by Louis
Fink, bishop of Kansas, because it facilitated
preaching and encouraged cohesion.

By the late nineteenth century, the Catholic
Church in the Great Plains was divided into
national parishes, which were distinct from official
territorial parishes, though often under the
same bishop. Italians, German Catholics, Irish,
and others listened to services in their own languages
and worshiped their own saints, continuing
the traditions of their homelands. Even
in the mid–twentieth century, such diverse expression
prevailed. Integration has since occurred,
with Hispanic Catholics remaining
most distinct.

By 1890 Catholics ranked first in terms of
religious adherents in the states of North Dakota
(44.4 percent), Montana (77.5 percent),
South Dakota (30.1 percent), Wyoming (61.4
percent), Colorado (54.3 percent), New Mexico
(95.1 percent), and Nebraska (26.5 percent);
second in Kansas (20.1 percent, behind
Methodists) and Oklahoma (25.9 percent, behind
Methodists); and third in Texas (14.7 percent,
behind Baptists and Methodists).

A century later, Catholicism had lost ground
to other denominations in much of the Plains,
especially to Baptists in the Southern Plains,
Lutherans in the Northern Plains, and Mormons
in Wyoming, while still remaining generally
the largest denomination in the region.
In the 1990s Catholicism ranked first in number
of adherents in the states of Montana (36.9
percent), Wyoming (27.5 percent), Colorado
(37.3 percent), Nebraska (33.3 percent), and
Kansas (27.3 percent); second in North Dakota
(35.8 percent, behind Lutheranism), South Dakota
(30.0 percent, behind Lutheranism), and
Texas (32.8 percent, behind Baptists); and fifth
in Oklahoma (6.8 percent, behind Baptists,
Methodists, and various Pentecostal and Holiness
groups). The religious landscape of the
Plains is still filled with Catholic churches,
schools, seminaries, hospitals, orphanages,
and monasteries (of which there are four in
both North and South Dakota).

In some parts of the Plains, especially areas
of Latino in-migration, the number of Catholics
is increasing. The diocese of Lubbock,
Texas, for example, was established in 1983
in response to the growing population of adherents.
But more generally in the region, the
future for Catholicism is clouded. Since the
1960s the numbers of priests and nuns have
declined significantly, and many now are aged.
Few young men and women are replacing
them. There are relatively few counties in the
Plains where every congregation has a resident
priest. In each of Pembina and Stutsman
Counties, North Dakota, and Custer County,
Nebraska, in 1990, for example, there were
more than six congregations without resident
priests. The trend suggests that, barring radical
changes, such as allowing priests to marry
or women to be ordained, the number of parishioners
served by each priest is only going
to increase as Roman Catholicism is stretched
thin over much of the Plains.
