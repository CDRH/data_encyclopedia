TACHÉ, ALEXANDRE-ANTONIN (1823-1894)

Born on July 23, 1823, in Rivière-du-Loup,
Quebec, Alexandre-Antonin Taché completed
his classical studies at the Saint Hyacinthe
College and studied theology at the Seminary
of Montreal prior to entering the noviciate of
the Oblates of Mary Immaculate in Longueuil.
In 1845 he was sent as a subdeacon to serve
in the Red River missions, thereby becoming
the first French Canadian Oblate to serve in
the Canadian Northwest. He was named coadjutor
bishop of St. Boniface in 1850, bishop
in 1853, and archbishop in 1871.

As a pioneer missionary and bishop, Taché
contributed significantly to the establishment
of the Catholic Church in western Canada. In
1870 he was asked by the Canadian government
to be its mediator during the events
known as the Red River Resistance. He was
instrumental in negotiating a settlement but
later criticized the government for having
broken its promise to grant a complete amnesty
to all participants, including Louis Riel.
Taché regarded Manitoba as a sister province
of Quebec, and hence, he and his clergy strove
incessantly to promote French Canadian immigration
to the Northwest. He was also a vigilant
defender of the linguistic and educational
rights of French-speaking Catholics in
the Northwest. The last years of Taché's life
were involved in the controversy surrounding
the abolition of confessional schools in Manitoba
and the suppression of French as an official
language. He wrote numerous pamphlets
and letters denouncing this legislation. He
died in St. Boniface on June 22, 1894.
