UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA

The action that brought into being the United
Church of Canada was the culmination of
successive initiatives beginning with the merger
of the four sections of Presbyterianism in
1875 to form the "Presbyterian Church in Canada."
The Methodists followed suit in 1884 and
the Congregationalists in 1906. The actual negotiations
leading up to the formation of
the United Church of Canada began when the
Board of Home Missions of both the Presbyterian
and Methodist Churches, concerned
over the duplication of services, especially in
the West, adopted a plan of amalgamation.
The initial step was to develop a "Basis of
Union," founded on goodwill, concession,
and compromise and which included a strategy
for informing and educating members
and adherents. The first meeting of the Joint
Union Committee was held in Toronto, on
April 21, 1904. It reached the unanimous conclusion
"that organic union is both desirable
and practicable." Invitations were extended
to the Church of England and the Baptist
churches in Canada. Although cordially received,
the judicatories of these bodies respectfully
declined to participate in a wider
dialogue of church union. By 1908 a basis of
union was agreed upon and was subsequently
ratified by plebiscites.

In the meantime, there came into existence
in western Canada, mainly in Saskatchewan, a
large number of local union churches, which
formed the "General Council of Local Union
Churches." Beginning in 1921, representatives
of the council were welcomed to the early
meetings of the Joint Union Committee. Draft
bills for the Parliament of Canada and provincial
legislatures were prepared and carefully
considered during the years 1921â€“24. These
were approved by the supreme courts of the
churches. The necessary legislation was enacted
in 1924 by Parliament, and from 1924 to
1926 by the legislatures of the various provinces.
On June 10, 1925, the union of the three
churches was solemnly consummated in the
Mutual Street Arena, Toronto, in the presence
of more than 8,000 members.

The United Church of Canada is the largest
Protestant denomination in Canada. In 1990 it
was the leading denomination in much of
southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan,
and southwestern Manitoba, and the second
largest denomination, after Catholicism, elsewhere
in virtually all of rural Alberta and in
those parts of southern Saskatchewan and
southern Manitoba where it was not first in
church membership.

The United Church is dedicated to being a
uniting church, reaching out to diverse sectors
of Canadian society. It covers a wide spectrum
of beliefs and is committed to ecumenism. The
church has a strong tradition of voluntary services
and a larger share of rural congregations
than most other denominations. Women have
been able to become ordained ministers since
1936. The liberal thinking of the church is perhaps
best exemplified by the statement of the
General Council on August 15, 1986, which
strongly repudiated the policies of its Methodist
and Presbyterian forebears in promoting
assimilation programs among Native Canadians,
policies that continued into the twentieth
century in the context of residential
boarding schools. The council asked Native
peoples to forgive the church for the irreparable
damage it had done and looked toward a
future of reconciliation and healing.
