ALEXANDER, GROVER CLEVELAND (1887-1950)


Grover Cleveland Alexander


One of baseball's greatest pitchers, Grover
Cleveland Alexander was inducted into the
National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1938. His
twenty-year career produced 373 victories,
tying him with Christy Mathewson for most
victories by a National League pitcher and
placing him behind only Cy Young and Walter
Johnson for major-league wins.

The son of an Elba, Nebraska, farmer, Alexander
was born on February 26, 1887. His
major-league career began in 1911 with the
Philadelphia Phillies. At the end of his rookie
season, he led the league in victories, shutouts,
complete games, and innings pitched. From
1913 to 1917 Alexander's record was a stunning
143 wins and 50 losses. In the 1915 World Series
he pitched the Phillies' only victory.

From 1919 to 1925 Alexander was the mainstay
of the Chicago Cubs pitching staff. Placed
on waivers in 1926, he was picked up by the St.
Louis Cardinals and helped them clinch a
pennant. The 1926 World Series against the
New York Yankees produced Alexander's most
remembered achievement, as he won two
games and, in game seven, struck out Tony
Lazzeri with the bases loaded.

After his 373rd victory in 1929, Alexander
went on a drinking binge that ended his season.
With the Phillies in 1930, he lost three
starts, and his major-league career was over.
Drinking problems marred his remaining
years. He died in St. Paul, Nebraska, on November
4, 1950. A 1952 film biography starring
Ronald Reagan, The Winning Team, highlighted
Alexander's 1926 World Series heroics
while downplaying his alcoholism.
