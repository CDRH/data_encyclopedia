Kurt Browning, sometimes called "Gene Kelly
on Ice," set a new standard in the world of
figure skating. The Canadian earned worldwide
popularity due to his remarkable talent,
showmanship, and sense of humor.

Born on June 18, 1966, in Rocky Mountain
House, Alberta, Browning grew up playing
hockey in Caroline, Alberta. He showed a natural
talent for figure skating and at the age
of sixteen moved to Edmonton to train. On
March 25, 1988, he added his name to the
Guinness Book of World Records by becoming
the first person to successfully land a quadruple jump in competition. This athletic
ability, in addition to his artistry, led to
four Canadian championships and four world
championship gold medals. The only amateur
achievement that eluded him was an Olympic
medal. The 1994 Olympic Games were not unrewarding,
however, as he was given the honor
of carrying the Canadian flag at the opening
ceremonies.

Browning retired from amateur competition
in 1994 and continued improving his
skills at the professional level. He captured the
titles of world professional champion three
times, Canadian professional champion four
times, and U.S. professional champion twice.
He was inducted into the Canadian Figure
Skating Hall of Fame on January 30, 2000.

The town of Caroline is proud of its hometown
hero, and Browning still maintains his
connections to the Plains. He serves as the
honorary spokesperson for KidSport Society
of Alberta, dedicated to "overcoming the
obstacles that prevent some young people
from playing sport." He was also proud to be
named honorary captain for the Edmonton
Oilers hockey team. In 1996 Kurt married
Sonia Rodriguez, a principal dancer with the
National Ballet of Canada, and they now live
in Toronto, Ontario, when he is not on the
road entertaining.
