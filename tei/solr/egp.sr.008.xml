CLEMENT, AMANDA (1888-1971)

Amanda Clement was born on March 20,
1888, in Hudson, South Dakota. She became
the first paid female umpire in men's baseball.
Her career occurred quite by accident. Two
lodge teams were scheduled to play a game
before her brother's semipro game when the
umpire did not show up. Her brother suggested
that they ask Amanda. Clement's umpiring
was so fair that her brother's team
and other semipro teams enlisted her services.
Subsequently, from about 1904 to 1911, she
umpired about fifty semipro games each summer
in the Dakotas, Nebraska, Minnesota,
and Iowa, earning between $15 and $25 per
game.

Being a professional umpire in the early
twentieth century was not only a man's occupation
but was also dangerous. Several
minor-league umpires lost their lives, and
many minor and major leaguers were assaulted
by angry fans. Yet Clement never experienced
any abuse. Fans and players respected
her expertise. Gamblers liked her because her
calls could not be bought. Baseball promoters
delighted in her drawing power as the "Only
Lady Umpire in the World." And sportswriters
enjoyed bragging that "South Dakota has
a woman umpire who is said to be about
the best preserver of the peace in the whole
northwest."

Amanda Clement in many ways epitomized
the modern woman. An all-around athlete,
she made her mark in history by being the first
woman baseball umpire, but she also worked
as a newspaper reporter, city assessor, justice
of the peace, and social worker. She died on
July 20, 1971, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
