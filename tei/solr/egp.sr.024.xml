GRETZKY, WAYNE (b. 1961)
 
Wayne Gretzky and teammates with the Stanley Cup
     
    
Wayne Gretzky was not born in the Great
Plains, but his name will always be associated
with Great Plains ice hockey. Gretzky, born on
January 26, 1961, in Brantford, Ontario, is one
of the greatest ice hockey players of all time.
He started his professional career in the World
Hockey Association (WHA) by playing for the
Indianapolis Racers and Edmonton Oilers before
moving in 1979 into the National Hockey
League (NHL) with the Oilers, wearing number
99. His nine seasons with the Oilers established
him as arguably the greatest ever to play
the game. While in Edmonton, Gretzky was
awarded the Hart Trophy, given to the NHL's
most valuable player, every year from 1980 to
1987 and again in 1989 as well as the Art Ross
Trophy for the league's scoring leader eight
times (1981–87, 1990–91, and 1994). During
the 1981–82 season he scored the fastest fifty
goals and 100 points in one season (thirtyeight
games). He holds fourteen NHL career
records and led the Oilers to five Stanley Cups.

Gretzky became a hockey icon in Edmonton
and developed similar followings playing
for the Los Angeles Kings (1988–95), St. Louis
Blues (1995–96), and New York Rangers (1996
to his retirement in 1999). With his popularity
among the fans and his numerous trophies,
awards, and honors, it is easy to understand
why Wayne Gretzky was named the top player
of all time in 1998 by the Hockey News and was
inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in
1999.
