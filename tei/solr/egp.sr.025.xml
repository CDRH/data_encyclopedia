GYMNASTICS

Although gymnastics has had its greatest development
in the Midwest, Northeast, and Pacific
region of the United States, universities,
high schools, and clubs in the Great Plains,
especially in Nebraska and Oklahoma, are
known for their gymnastics traditions and
successes. Men's teams at the Universities of
Nebraska and Oklahoma have been among
the finest in the nation. Under coach Francis
Allen, Nebraska won eight men's National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships
between 1979 and 1994. After 1964
Nebraska won thirteen Big 8 Conference titles.
Nebraska gymnasts such as James Hartung
have stood out at the highest levels of competition.
The University of Oklahoma has won
three men's NCAA championships and seven
Big 8 titles. Oklahoma's best-known gymnast
is Bart Conner, a 1984 Olympic gold medal
winner. Oklahoma women won the Big 8 title
five times and placed second in the 1997 Big 12
championships; Nebraska women won the
1997 Big 12 event.

Other colleges such as the University of
Denver, the United States Air Force Academy,
the University of North Dakota, Texas Tech,
Hardin-Simmons, and Odessa College have
sponsored varsity or club gymnastics. The
U.S. Olympic Committee maintains a training
center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The
Maverick Boys Club and Nard's Trampoline
Club in Amarillo, Texas, were among the earliest
gymnastics clubs in the region, and the
Sokol (ethnic Czechoslovakian) Clubs of
Omaha, Nebraska, and Fort Worth, Texas,
have long gymnastics traditions. The most accomplished
gymnastics Olympian of the region
is Shannon Miller of the Dynamo Gymnastics
Club in Edmond, Oklahoma, who won
seven medals in the 1992 and 1996 games.
