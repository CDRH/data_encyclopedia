BOARD OF RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS

The Board of Railway Commissioners of Canada
regulated all the major railways in Canada
under the authority of the Railway Act of 1903. A
broad coalition of interests, including Prairie
farmers and merchants, supported the creation
of this independent regulatory commission,
similar to the American Interstate Commerce
Commission. The Canadian government appointed
three commissioners to supervise a
wide range of activities, including the establishment
of rules and regulations for employees, the
inspection of new lines, the installation of safety
devices, and the investigation of accidents. In
1908 an additional three commissioners were
appointed and were expected to regulate the
railway, express, telegraph, telephone, and hydroelectric
business. The commissioners' most
publicly visible activity involved the regulation
of freight and passenger rates, and their actions
influenced the rate structure in Canada, nowhere
more dramatically than in the Prairie
Provinces.

Between 1907 and 1914, the commissioners
gradually eliminated a number of rate advantages
enjoyed by merchants in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, since the nineteenth century. These
changes allowed rapidly growing business
communities in Regina, Calgary, and other
towns to compete with Winnipeg as distributing
and service centers. Western business leaders
continued to complain that the railways
granted lower rates to their competitors outside
the region, in central Canada. To address
these concerns, the commissioners consistently
recommended higher rate increases in
central than in western Canada during and
immediately following World War I. As a result,
between 1914 and 1921, a 34 percent difference
between central Canadian and Prairie
western rates on fifth-class freight (the most
common classification of merchandise distributed
in carloads) had been narrowed to 14
percent. Thereafter, the railway commissioners
addressed more specific Prairie grievances,
particularly related to commodities such as
grain and livestock. Against the advice of the
railway commissioners, the Canadian government
reintroduced the 1897 Crow's Nest Pass
rates on grain in 1922, rates that remained in
effect and controversial until the 1980s.
