DODGE, GRENVILLE (1831-1916)

Born in Danvers, Massachusetts, on April 12,
1831, Grenville Mellen Dodge graduated from
Norwich University and Partridge's Military
School, both in Norwich, Vermont, as a military
and industrial engineer. During the 1850s
he surveyed and constructed railroads in Iowa
and engaged in business and banking in Council
Bluffs in addition to trading with Plains
Indians.

Dodge used both his engineering and his
military skills during the Civil War, rising
from captain to major general. During the
conflict's final months, as commander of the
Department of the Missouri, his command
was expanded to reopen Plains mail routes
and protect telegraph lines. Dodge was appointed
chief engineer of the Union Pacific
Railroad in January 1866 and occupied that
position until 1870. His work for the Union
Pacific was his greatest accomplishment and
won him renown as a railroad builder.

Dodge resigned from the road in January
1870 (although he continued to be associated
with the line for many years) and devoted the
next three decades to building railroads and
organizing railroad companies. These lines lay
in the southern United States, Mexico, and
Cuba. He also served as consultant to German
and Italian engineers as they constructed a
tunnel through the Alps.

Dodge devoted his final years to promoting
railroad legislation, working in patriotic organizations,
and writing on engineering and
military subjects. He died at his home in
Council Bluffs, Iowa, on January 3, 1916, survived
by his wife, Anne, whom he had married
on May 29, 1854, and three daughters.
