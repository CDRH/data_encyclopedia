MERIDIAN HIGHWAY

The Meridian Highway, now U.S. Route 81, is a
major north–south route that transects the
Great Plains from Canada to Mexico. The highway
follows the land division grid of the Great
Plains from Winnipeg, Manitoba, through
North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas,
Oklahoma, and Texas to Mexico, parallel to
the sixth principal meridian. Established in
1911–12, it was originally known as the Meridian
Road. Later renamed the Meridian Highway,
it has been called North America's first
international automotive highway.

The Meridian Highway evolved primarily as a
farm-to-market road, important to the rural
areas, small towns, and cities through which it
passed. The original route followed section line
roads, running perpendicular to historic east–west
transportation corridors. Reflecting its creation
from existing farm-to-market rural roads,
the original highway passed through each
county seat along its route. In 1911 the Meridian
Road Association was formed to mark,
map, and promote the highway; in 1919 it became
the Meridian Highway Association. Similar
to contemporaneous good roads organizations,
the Meridian Highway Association
consisted of representatives from the states,
counties, and cities along the route. The Meridian
Highway promoters, however, perhaps
in recognition of its divergence from more established
routes, emphasized the absence of
mountain passes and proclaimed that motorists
could travel from Canada to Mexico without
shifting gears. The association sold memberships
and instituted widely publicized
tours. When the association was a year old, in
1912, an automobile caravan was organized to
travel the route south to Mexico, an event that
was irregularly repeated in subsequent years.

As a north–south route that cut through
the heart of the Great Plains, the Meridian
Highway was relatively unrestricted by geographic
barriers. The highway's few major
river crossings, therefore, were of tremendous
importance. A significant evolution of the
route into a modern highway was the completion
of the Meridian Highway Bridge in 1924
at the Missouri River between Yankton, South
Dakota, and Nebraska.

Like other early named highways, the Meridian
changed from its inception with road
improvements that included abandonment of
the route through urban areas and the establishment
of improved two- or four-lane sections.
In recent years, the Meridian Highway
Association was reestablished as the U.S. 81
Association. Its goals include promotional activities
to provide economic benefit for states
and communities along the route. The association,
however, is less concerned with preservation
of the original route and instead
hopes to transform U.S. 81 into a major four-lane
north–south highway.
