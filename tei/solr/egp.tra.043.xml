YELLOWSTONE TRAIL

The Yellowstone Trail was one of the first
transcontinental highways. In April 1912 a
group of local businessmen began to create an
improved highway from Ipswich, South Dakota,
to nearby Aberdeen. This effort was led
by local booster, state senator, and "good
roads" advocate Joseph W. Parmley. Parmley
saw that the automobile would come to dominate
commerce in the years ahead and was
determined that his town not be left behind.

From this humble beginning the Yellowstone
Trail Association was organized in October
1912 to promote a marked highway from
the Twin Cities to Yellowstone National Park
via Aberdeen. Boosters along the route began
painting the association logo–a yellow circle
with a black arrow pointing in the direction of
Yellowstone–on roadside poles, trees, and
even rocks. The association achieved a major
victory in 1914 by successfully lobbying the
National Park Service to allow private autos
into Yellowstone Park.

The Yellowstone Trail quickly emerged as
the most important northern highway and the
primary auto tourist route to and from Yellowstone.
During its heyday in the early 1920s
the Yellowstone Trail Association maintained
a permanent office in Minneapolis along with
numerous tourist bureaus in prominent cities
along the route. Information tents were placed
at strategic highway junctions to entice travelers
to take the Yellowstone Trail instead of
some other route. The Yellowstone Trail Association
was supported by private memberships
held by businesses along the route.

Private highway associations began to decline
in 1926 after the passage of federal highway
legislation, which established the U.S.
Route numbering system and placed the federal
government in the forefront of highway
construction. With the federal government
now marking and funding highways, the primary
functions of the private highway association
disappeared. In the late 1920s, like so
many other highway groups, the Yellowstone
Trail Association fell on hard economic times.
It was permanently disbanded in 1930.
