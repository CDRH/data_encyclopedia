BEECHER ISLAND, BATTLE OF

The Battle of Beecher Island was one of the
most publicized engagements fought between
Plains Indians and the U.S. Army. On September
17, 1868, on a sandbar in the middle of the
Arickaree River in eastern Colorado, a large
group of Cheyenne Dog Soldiers, Arapahos,
and Lakotas attacked fifty citizen scouts under
the command of Maj. George A. Forsyth. The
scouts held off repeated charges before the Indians
departed.

The scouts survived by eating the meat of
their horses for nine days before reinforcements
arrived from Fort Wallace, Kansas. Forsyth's
command sustained losses of five scouts
killed and eighteen wounded. Included among
the dead was Lt. Frederick H. Beecher, the
nephew of the outspoken New York abolitionist
Henry Ward Beecher. Forsyth named the
battle in memory of Lieutenant Beecher.

The Indian records obtained years later
by George Bent and George B. Grinnell accounted
for nine warriors killed and an unknown
number wounded. One casualty was
the esteemed warrior Roman Nose, a Northern
Cheyenne member of the Crooked Lance
Society. The Cheyennes referred to the battle as
"the fight where Roman Nose was killed." Although
the battle held little significance for the
Indians, the scouts' successful defensive stand
against extreme odds was inevitably compared
to the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and consequently
came to hold epic and symbolic importance
for Americans. The sensationalism
it generated indirectly led to an infusion of
new troops into the Plains, culminating in the
Washita campaign.
