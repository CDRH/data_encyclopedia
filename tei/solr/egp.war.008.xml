BLEEDING KANSAS
 
Contemporary iconography of the "Bleeding Kansas" political controversy


Bleeding Kansas is the term used to describe
the violence that flared in Kansas Territory
from 1855 to 1856 (and continued on a smaller
scale until 1861). Behind this lay the nation's
territorial expansion, beginning with the Louisiana
Purchase in 1803, of which Kansas
formed a part. Westward migration into the
Mississippi Valley, steam-powered transportation,
the prospect of a transcontinental railroad
through the central United States, an unending
land hunger, and acquisition of further
western territory from 1845 to 1848 all spurred
settlement of the midwestern prairies and
sharpened the sectional rivalry between slave
and free states.

In 1854, by the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Congress
repealed a prohibition on extending
slavery in the Louisiana Territory north of
36º30'. The outcome was tumultuous, inaugurated
by angry debates in Congress and the
press. There followed the birth of the Republican Party, dedicated to the nonextension of
slavery, the demise of the nationalist Whig
Party, and sectional division of the Democratic
Party, sponsor of the law.

The Kansas-Nebraska Act authorized formation
of a territorial government in Kansas, lying
directly west of slaveholding Missouri. Missourians,
concentrated in the slave-owning,
hemp-growing northwestern corner, feared that
formation of a free territory would jeopardize
their interests. Violence, fraud, murder, rivalry
for land, and a supine federal response created
the "Kansas Question," which dominated national
politics from 1854 to 1858. In 1855 some
5,000 Missourians helped elect a proslavery legislature.
Gov. Andrew Reeder declined to repudiate
the fraud and allowed the legislature to
establish a proslavery government. Antislavery
groups drafted a "free-state" constitution, held
elections, and established an antislavery government.
Two territorial governments now existed,
one fraudulent but recognized by President
Franklin Pierce, the other extralegal and rejected
by him. Tension erupted into violence in
November and December 1855 in the "Wakarusa
War," participated in by 1,500 "border ruffians."
Temporarily quelled by the territorial governor,
violence little short of civil war again broke out
in 1856 when border ru.ans sacked the freestate
town of Lawrence. In response, a small
band led by the fanatical abolitionist John
Brown murdered five proslavery settlers, and
guerrilla warfare raged. "Bleeding Kansas"
brought death to about 200 persons and destroyed
about $2 million in property.

Congress bitterly debated a proslavery constitution,
refusing to accept it, though it enjoyed
President James Buchanan's support.
The national crisis was marked by the nearvictory
of the newborn Republican Party in the
presidential election of 1856, the Dred Scott
decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857,
which mandated that Congress could not constitutionally
prohibit slavery in the territories,
and the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858 that
dramatically argued the territorial question.

Congress referred the proslavery constitution
to Kansans, resulting in a resounding rejection
tied to a stipulation that rejection entailed
postponement of statehood. By the time
of the vote–August 2, 1858–migration of free-state
settlers had decided the issue. Contrary
to myth, neither antislavery New Englanders
nor Deep South settlers affected the result.
The peopling of Kansas followed a more normal
migrational pattern. The census of 1860
showed that all slave states had contributed
27,440 persons; three free Ohio Valley states–
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois–alone sent 30,929 settlers
of a total population of 107,204. The
census ironically disclosed that only two blacks
lived in Kansas Territory; the next year Kansas
entered the Union a free state. But the issue of
federal authority over slavery in the territories
endured, splitting the nation in 1861.
