CRAZY HORSE (ca. 1840-1877)

"A sketch of Crazy Horse believed to be accurate. It was drawn in 1934 by a sketch artist interviewing Crazy Horse's daughter, who claimed it was an accurate image."


Crazy Horse was born near Bear Butte, South
Dakota, around 1840. He was the son of Crazy
Horse, a distinguished Oglala Lakota warrior
and medicine man, and Rattle Blanket Woman,
a Miniconjou Lakota.

The life of Crazy Horse nearly bracketed the
years of violent contact between the Lakotas
and the United States. A war chief of the Oglala,
Crazy Horse contested American expansion
into Lakota lands in the Northern Great
Plains. During Red Cloud's War, Crazy Horse
demonstrated his military prowess in the Fetterman
Fight at Fort Phil Kearny (1866), the
Hayfield Fight (1867), and the Wagon Box
Fight (1867). The Lakotas' military success persuaded
the government to negotiate, and after
prolonged discussions Red Cloud and some
Lakota chiefs signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of
1868. Crazy Horse and other Lakota leaders,
however, refused to acknowledge the treaty.

Crazy Horse's reputation as a war leader
earned the admiration of the Lakotas and
Northern Cheyennes and of tribal enemies of
the Lakotas such as the Crows. His unyielding
opposition toward the demands of the U.S.
government and toward the reservation regime
made him a central figure among the
nontreaty Oglala and Miniconjou Lakotas and
the Northern Cheyennes, who increasingly
looked to him for leadership after 1868. Crazy
Horse earned his highest formal honor in 1868
when he was selected as one of the head warriors,
or shirt-wearers, of the Oglalas.

Crazy Horse was a shirt-wearer until 1871,
when an affair with a married woman (Black
Buffalo Woman, Red Cloud's niece) cost him
this prestigious position. Crazy Horse kept a
sizable following, however, because of his determined
opposition to the United States. By
the mid-1870s government officials and army
officers recognized him as one of the most
prominent leaders of the Lakota resistance.

The 1874 discovery of gold in the Black Hills
strengthened the determination of the government
to purchase the Black Hills, which
angered nearly all Lakota leaders, whether
they were signatories of the 1868 Fort Laramie
Treaty or not. Negotiations between the government
and the Lakotas broke down, and in
December of 1875 the government ordered
Lakota bands living in the unceded areas
along the Yellowstone and Powder Rivers to
report within six weeks to the reservations or
face military action.

Not wishing to move their villages during
the winter and unsure of the government's intention,
Crazy Horse and other Lakota and
Northern Cheyenne leaders refused. The government
insisted on the move, and in March
1876 army units attacked a Northern Cheyenne
village mistakenly identified as that of
Crazy Horse. The army's destruction of the
Northern Cheyenne village convinced Crazy
Horse to prepare for an all-out defensive war
against the army.

On June 17, 1876, Crazy Horse and approximately
1,500 warriors defeated a military column
led by Brig. Gen. George Crook on Rosebud
Creek in southern Montana. On June 25,
1876, Crazy Horse was involved in the destruction
of Custer's Seventh Cavalry at the Little
Bighorn. Despite these defeats, the army persevered
against the Indians in the Powder
River–Yellowstone River region through the
winter of 1876–77. On May 7, 1877, Crazy
Horse and his band surrendered at Fort Robinson,
Nebraska.

His contempt for reservation life notwithstanding,
Crazy Horse realized there was no
viable alternative for the beleaguered Lakotas.
Initially government officials and army officers
sought him out, and their attention
caused jealousy among Oglala and Sicanju
(Brulé) Lakota chiefs, who spread false rumors
about Crazy Horse. Junior army officers
were persuaded that Crazy Horse was plotting
rebellion and they decided to arrest him. On
September 5, 1877, during an attempt to imprison
Crazy Horse at Fort Robinson, an army
sentry bayoneted him. He died a few hours
later. He was survived by two wives and no
children.
