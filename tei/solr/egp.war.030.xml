NATIONAL GUARD

National Guards in the Great Plains developed
later than in states to the east or west. Territorial
status and sparse population hindered
guard development, as did limited financial
support. South Dakota, for example, appropriated
only $500 for its guard in 1895, and
Texas, despite its large population, could support
only 3,000 guardsmen until 1910. In part,
Great Plains states appropriated limited funds
for the guard because few of them faced labor
disorders or urban upheavals. Colorado was
the great exception, with labor turbulence in
its mining region from the 1880s through the
"Ludlow Massacre" of 1914. But even with an
extensive record of policing mining regions,
the Colorado guard garnered only limited
state support.

The Great Plains National Guard became
effcient only after 1900, when federal subsidies
began to underwrite state military budgets.
Guardsmen continued to assist state officials
during natural disasters and civil disorders,
but increased federal support inevitably led to
greater federal control. By the 1980s federal
support accounted for more than 90 percent
of the guard's support. Federal aid also imposed
mandatory service on guardsmen. Great
Plains guardsmen have served in World War I,
World War II, Korea, the Persian Gulf War in
1991, and Iraq in 2003 under this obligation.
The National Guard remains a locally oriented
institution, proudly aware of its state and regional
identification, but is nonetheless more a
product of the federal government than of the
states.
