PIKE, ZEBULON (1779-1813)

"Portrait of Zebulon Pike, about 1810"
  

Zebulon Montgomery Pike, army officer
and explorer, substantially added to early-nineteenth-century
knowledge of the Central
and Southern Plains. He is remembered
mainly for his description of the region as a
"Great Sandy Desert" and for Pikes Peak, the
Colorado mountain that bears his name.

Son of an army officer, he was born at Lamberton
(today Lamington), New Jersey, on January
5, 1779. In 1794 young Pike became a cadet,
and five years later he was commissioned
as a second lieutenant of the infantry. In 1805,
while serving in Illinois, he led a small party up
the Mississippi River to locate its source and to
select sites for future army posts. The next
spring he received orders to lead a party across
the Central Plains to find the headwaters of the
Arkansas and Red Rivers. The expedition, including
twenty-one soldiers, an interpreter,
and a civilian doctor, rode west out of St. Louis
on July 15, 1806. They crossed Kansas to the
Rocky Mountains and into Spanish territory.
There, severe winter threatened their survival,
forcing them to surrender to the Spanish.
They were taken south to Chihuahua,
Mexico, but in 1807 President Thomas Jefferson
secured their release. Early in the War of
1812, Pike was promoted to brigadier general.
He died on April 27, 1813, in an explosion of a
British powder magazine during the capture of
York (Toronto), Ontario.
