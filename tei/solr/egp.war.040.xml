SAN SABÁ MISSION, DESTRUCTION OF

Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá, founded for
the eastern Apaches in April 1757, near presentday
Menard, Texas, was sacked and burned on
March 16, 1758, by an allied Native American
force of about 2,000 Comanches, Tejas, Tonkawas,
and others. At least eight persons, including
two of the three Franciscan missionaries
present, were slain during the attack. The nearby
presidio, San Luis de las Amarillas, four
miles farther up the San Saba River, was powerless
to intervene. Although the Spanish Franciscan
friars, headed by Fray Alonso Giraldo de
Terreros, had failed to congregate the Apaches
for religious instruction, the allied northern
tribes had been alarmed at the prospect of a
Spanish-Apache alliance.

The attack represented the first major conflict
between Comanches and European American
settlers in Texas. Combined with the failed
Spanish punitive military expedition to a
Wichita (Taovaya) village on the Red River a
year later, it demonstrated that the Spanish
faced a new type of enemy with greatly expanded
capabilities. French firearms had replaced bows and arrows, and the allied Indians
had vastly superior numbers. No longer
was a ragged Spanish militia, drawn randomly
from untrained civilian settlers, capable
of holding the frontier. The Spanish advance
from Texas toward the Great Plains was
halted.
