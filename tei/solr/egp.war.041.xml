SEVEN OAKS MASSACRE

The chain of events leading to the Seven Oaks
Massacre began in the spring of 1816, when the
Hudson's Bay Company destroyed the North
West Company's Fort Gibraltar at the junction
of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. The
attack was a part of the companies' intense
struggle for the control of the Northern Plains
fur and meat trade; its immediate goal was to
expel the Nor'westers from the Red River Settlement
by cutting off their supply lines from
the Plains. As a counterstrike, the North West
Company sent Cuthbert Grant and about
sixty Métis provisioners to open and secure
the road to the Red River.

On June 19, 1816, Grant's force encountered
a Hudson's Bay Company party at an oak hill
near the destroyed Fort Gibraltar. The group,
about twenty-five strong, was led by Robert
Semple, the governor of the Red River Settlement,
who was determined to get rid of
the Nor'westers. The Semple party opened
fire, and a fierce fight broke out. The morenumerous
Métis caught their opponents in a
deadly crossfire and killed Sample and twenty
of his followers while suffering only one casualty
themselves.

The Seven Oaks Massacre was the bloodiest
incident in the forty-year struggle between the
Hudson's Bay and North West Companies. It
initiated a period of extremely tense relations
and provoked the Hudson's Bay Company to
attack Fort William in August 1816. The violent
cycle continued until 1821, when the companies
merged under the name of the Hudson's
Bay Company.
