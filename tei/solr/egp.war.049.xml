TROPADE GENÍZARO

During the eighteenth century, Indian slavery
and the slave trade were important components
in relations between the New Mexican
Spanish and Native Americans of the Great
Plains. Captives who had been acculturated
and paid their ransom debt were discharged
by their Spanish masters and entered Spanish
society as genízaros. The term is from "janissary,"
which referred to Christian captives
who entered Turkish service.

The genízaros, many of whom came from
the ranks of such Plains tribes as Plains
Apaches, Jumanos, Comanches, Kiowas, Pawnees,
Wichitas, and possibly Crows, lacked legal
and social status and land; consequently,
they settled at frontier outposts from El Paso
to north of Santa Fe, where they received land
and protected the colony from surrounding
Indian raiders–Apaches, Comanches, Navajos,
and Utes. In time they developed civilian
(trader, weaver, rancher, farmer) and military
occupations. Many traded with Plains Indians
during peaceful times. They continued as an
unorganized military force known for their
bravery and fighting ability, both as militia
troops and scouts. Their economic status improved
with the horses, livestock, and other
goods that they were allowed to keep from
successful campaigns.

The genízaro militia was officially recognized
and formally organized in 1808 as the
Tropa de Genizaro. It was commanded by a
corporal from their own ranks and based in
Santa Fe. They had an organized supply system,
which provided the militia with equipment
and expendable supplies. With the end
of Spanish rule in 1821, the segregated genizaro
troops disappeared as they merged with the
regular Mexican militia.
