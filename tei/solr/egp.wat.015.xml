MNI SOSE INTERTRIBAL WATER RIGHTS COALITION

Logo for the Mni Sose Intertribal Water Rights Coalition

    

The Mni Sose Intertribal Water Rights Coalition
was organized in 1993 to enable the
twenty-eight American Indian Nations in the
Missouri River basin to seek legal, administrative,
economic, and physical control over their
water resources. Since its inception, the coalition
has been engaged in a constant effort to
educate U.S. agencies and congressional committees
about the treaty and trust responsibilities
of the federal government. For example,
under the Flood Control Act of 1944, which
authorized the Pick-Sloan Plan, eight reservations
relinquished a total of 350,000 acres, or
23 percent of the total land appropriated for
the construction of the five earthen dams to
control flooding along the Missouri River. Although
a $1.3 billion economic benefit is derived
from these projects each year, the tribes
have shared in little of the revenues. However,
based upon the efforts of the coalition, the
tribes are now in the process of approving contracts
for allocations of hydropower from the
Pick-Sloan dams, which will ultimately result
in lower electrical rates on the reservations.

The coalition is also working with federal and
other agencies to develop partnerships with
tribes to support tribal water uses, conduct research,
and encourage technology transfer to
improve water resource development and cultural
protection of the environment. With the
assistance of the Mni Sose Intertribal Water
Rights Coalition, tribes are moving from a passive
to an active role in protecting their tribal
homelands. They are now acquiring the legislative,
administrative, and operational capabilities
to govern, manage, and protect their tribal water
resources.
