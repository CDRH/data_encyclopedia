PLAYA LAKES

Playa lakes are integral wetlands of the Southern
Great Plains. Playas, meaning "beach" in
Spanish, are found in semiarid environments
throughout the world but are most numerous
in the Playa Lakes Region of southwestern
Kansas, southeastern Colorado, the Oklahoma
Panhandle, eastern New Mexico, and
northwestern Texas. There are approximately
21,000 playa lakes on the Llano Estacado of
Texas and New Mexico alone.

Playas are the most apparent topographical
aspect of the essentially flat southern High
Plains. They are small depressional wetlands,
underlain by a clay soil, with a closed watershed.
Perhaps the most ephemeral wetlands in
North America, playas are dependent on localized,
unpredictable, late spring and summer
thunderstorms to collect and hold water.
Playas can therefore be dry or flooded at any
given time, and the plants and animals associated
with them have to be able to adapt to
such changeable conditions. Playas collect
nearly 90 percent of the precipitation runoff
on the southern High Plains and are the primary
source of flood control. Most overlie the
southern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer, and
they provide approximately 80 percent of its
annual water recharge. This is a critical function
of playas, because the southern High
Plains are heavily cultivated and grazed, and
both endeavors are dependent on the Ogallala
Aquifer.

Because of the dominance of agriculture,
playas are the primary remaining wildlife habitat
in the region. Most wildlife species in the
area depend on playa habitats for existence.
Thirty-seven mammalian species and almost
200 bird species have been reported in playas.
Playas constitute vital nesting, migration, and
wintering habitats for wetland birds, including
shore and wading species. It has been estimated
that nearly two million ducks, 600,000
geese, and 500,000 sandhill cranes winter in
playas during wet years. Playas are also the
principal breeding sites for amphibians in the
region.

A total of 346 plant species are associated
with playas. These include not only traditional
wetland species but also many prairie plants
no longer found in the surrounding uplands.
Playas therefore serve as a seed repository for
the flora of the region.

Threats to playas include physical alteration,
direct application of agricultural chemicals,
overgrazing, and sedimentation. Of these, sedimentation
is the most serious. Approximately
90 percent of playas surrounded by cropland
have lost their original volume due to sedimentation.
At the current rate, all playas could
fill with sediment within ninety-five years.
Fortunately, measures are being taken to prevent
or slow future sedimentation effects, restore
degraded playas, and conserve these precious
wetlands. These include taking land out
of production through the Conservation Reserve
Program, erosion control through contour
farming, and creating buffers of native
vegetation around the playas.
