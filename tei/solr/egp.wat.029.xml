SANDHILLS LAKES

In the Nebraska Sandhills, there are an estimated
175 square miles of shallow lakes and
ponds, about 100 square miles of marsh, and
more than 1,500 square miles of subirrigated
meadows. These water-dominated landscape
features make the Sandhills the second most
productive waterfowl region in the United
States. Lakes and wetlands occur where lowlying,
flat valley floors between grass-stabilized
sand dunes intersect the vast groundwater resource
of the High Plains, or Ogallala, Aquifer.
There is little or no surface water runoff into
these lakes. Sandhills lakes range in size from
less than 10 acres to more than 800 acres. Lake
areas fluctuate seasonally, depending on the
dynamic interaction of climatic and hydrologic
processes. The deepest Sandhills lake is
Blue Lake in Garden County, which is about
fifteen feet deep. More characteristic depths
are between two and four feet.

Chemical data indicate that the lakes are
compositionally diverse, ranging from fresh
to brine (total dissolved solids vary from less
than 200 milligrams per liter to more than
100,000 milligrams per liter). Alkalinity, as
calcium carbonate, ranges from less than 200
to greater than 100,000 milligrams per liter;
pH is usually greater than 8.0. Groundwater,
primarily derived from local precipitation, is
the principal source of water and dissolved
solids for the lakes. Differences in the chemistry
between lakes are a function of local hydrologic
variability, related to the magnitude
of inflow and outflow of water from a lake and
the age of the lake.
