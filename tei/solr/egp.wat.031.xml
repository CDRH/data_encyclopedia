STOCK PONDS

Stock ponds, generally small and sometimes
transitory, are nevertheless the most ubiquitous
source of water in the Great Plains.
They occur from Texas to Alberta, wherever
there is free-ranging livestock and su.cient
surface water or available groundwater. Frequency
of occurrence varies also with soil
type: there are fewer ponds on permeable
soils, such as loess, than on clay soils, which
hold the water at the surface. On the Southern
Plains they are known as tanks.

There are two types of stock ponds: the embankment
pond, which dams a stream or periodic
runoff channel, and the excavated pond,
where a hole is dug to intersect the water table.
The latter–common on floodplains and in
other areas, such as the Nebraska Sandhills,
where the water table is high–is more dependable
because groundwater fluctuates less than
surface runoff. Since the nineteenth century,
farmers have constructed their own ponds
using basic farm equipment; now larger projects
may necessitate heavy excavating equipment,
and subsidies are available through various
conservation programs.

Critics argue that the ponds contribute to
the depletion of river flow by impounding
runoff. In the balance, however, advantages
outweigh any disadvantages. The ponds are a
good source of livestock water, allowing wellwatered
cattle to range widely across pastures.
They are often stocked with fish for recreational
purposes, and they are points of attraction
for wildfowl, which breed there. And
aesthetically, the muddy stock pond, ringed by
attendant cattle, is a defining Plains scene.
