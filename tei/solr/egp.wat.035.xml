WATER LAW, PRAIRIE PROVINCES

The origin of European-based water law in the
Canadian Prairie Provinces lies with the Hudson's
Bay Company and the century of company
administration that followed establishment
of its first inland trading post on the
Saskatchewan River in 1774. Along with the
company's trade goods came a less tangible but
equally powerful force of change: English civil
and criminal law. Included within this complex
web of principles and procedures was the
doctrine of riparian rights. Under this doctrine,
water rights are restricted to those who
have title to property abutting upon bodies of
water, and each shoreline or riparian owner is
entitled to receive the flow of water to his or her
property undiminished except for that quantity
withdrawn by upstream riparians for their
domestic purposes. Given the situation where
water resources far outstripped the needs of
the small population settled along the Red
River and at the handful of company fur posts
farther west and north along the Prairie fringe,
the accepted doctrine of riparian rights remained
uncontroversial during the first decades
of European settlement.

Canada's purchase of the Hudson's Bay
Company's Rupert's Land territory in 1869
brought a new but nonetheless common law–
based administration. While the shared common
law tradition assured continuity in such
matters as riparian rights, federal authority
over navigable waterways was anchored in the
Canadian Constitution. A more direct and
far-reaching manifestation of Canadian authority
came in 1870 with the Manitoba Act
that created the first Prairie Province and governing
institutions for the territory beyond.
The act stipulated that control of all public
lands within the new province would remain
in federal hands, a precedent followed when
Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces
in 1905. The manner in which Ottawa intended
to administer public or Crown lands in
the West was outlined in the 1872 Dominion
Lands Act. Based largely upon the U.S. Homestead
Act, the Canadian statute implicitly recognized
homesteaders' riparian rights. As settlement
moved farther west on to the semiarid
southwestern Prairie known as Palliser's Triangle,
the shortcomings of the riparian rights
doctrine in water-scarce regions soon became
apparent. Following a comprehensive review
of water legislation in the western United
States and elsewhere, Parliament, guided by
irrigation enthusiast William Pearce, passed
the Northwest Irrigation Act (1894). Closely
modeled upon the Australian Crown Colony
of Victoria's 1886 Irrigation Act, the Canadian
legislation marked a radical departure from
the Anglo-Saxon riparian rights doctrine in
favor of the principle that surface waters
should be reserved for the public in the name
of the Crown, which would allocate water
rights in the common interest. Withdrawal of
water for other than domestic purposes was
subsequently managed through a licensing
system.

As the self-proclaimed arbiter of water access
in the dry belt, Ottawa immediately had
to confront the delicate issue of proposed water
diversion schemes on rivers that traversed
the Canadian-American border. The mechanism
to resolve di&#129;ãerences was found in the
International Joint Commission, a Canadian-American
intergovernmental body established
by the Boundary Waters Treaty (1909).

Power sites and facilities that relied on water
embraced another aspect of federal water
management. At first regulation was facilitated
under the general provision of the Dominion
Land Act requiring the proper management of
public lands, but by 1919 the electricity needs
of a growing and increasingly urban population
required the passage of a specific act. The
Dominion Water Power Act provided for the
granting of rights to the use of water for power
purposes, and where there were applications
to use the same supply of water for different
purposes, these could be adjusted with reference
to the two acts (Power and Irrigation),
bearing in mind that the Irrigation Act specified
that priority be given to water required
for domestic and municipal purposes, followed
by irrigation.

In 1930 federal jurisdiction over lands and
natural resources in the Prairie West was surrendered
to the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
and Alberta. With regard to water
law, the principles established in the federal
statutes were incorporated into provincial law
with only minor changes, and they remain the
foundation of contemporary legislation.
